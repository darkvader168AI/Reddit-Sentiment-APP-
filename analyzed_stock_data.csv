"Google gets to keep Chrome but is barred from exclusive search deals, judge rules",1n6ukgk,Puginator,2025-09-02 20:26:22,181,0.99,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n6ukgk/google_gets_to_keep_chrome_but_is_barred_from/,"A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Google can keep its Chrome browser but will be barred from exclusive contracts and must share search data.

In a landmark case filed in 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Google kept its share of the general search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that sustained its dominance.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in August 2024 that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies, saying the company has held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.

Google said it will appeal the ruling, which would delay any potential penalties.

"September feels heavy: seasonality, tariffs, shutdown talk, and Fed nerves all hitting at once",1n6udom,Optionslab,2025-09-02 20:19:23,2,0.58,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n6udom/september_feels_heavy_seasonality_tariffs/,"The market kicked off weak this week with the Nasdaq, S&P, and Dow all sliding lower. Honestly, it feels like there are too many headwinds piling up at the same time, and no one can agree on which one is the real driver.

September is usually a bad month for stocks anyway, especially for tech. Maybe this is just the classic seasonal slump playing out. But it also feels like the other stuff going on is making it worse. A federal appeals court just ruled most of Trump’s tariffs were illegal, which doesn’t kill tariffs forever but does leave everything messy. Nobody knows what the new rules will look like, which goods are impacted, or if companies might even get refunds for what’s already been collected. That kind of limbo is exactly what markets hate.

Then there’s the government shutdown risk. Congress has until September 30 to figure it out, and the odds of a shutdown are being thrown around at 40 percent. If it happens, you could see cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which would ripple through the economy. Maybe they pass a short-term patch that drags this into December, but even the back-and-forth in DC is enough to make investors nervous.

The Fed adds another layer. Nobody’s sure what their next move is, and stocks entered September priced for perfection, so the bar is high. When valuations are stretched like this, even a little bit of bad news can knock things down. Add in the jobs report coming on Friday, and you’ve got another potential swing factor hanging over the week.

So yeah, between seasonality, tariffs, shutdown talk, and Fed uncertainty, the market just feels heavy right now. I’m curious what everyone thinks is weighing the most. Are you making moves in your portfolio, or just sitting back and treating this like a normal September dip that will pass?",2025-09-02,-0.9143,Negative,"['SNAP', 'DC']"

My understanding is that we have 3 options.

Option 1, peg gold at its current price, and don’t address the deficit immediately.  This would require a period of extreme austerity and fiscal discipline.

Option 2, peg gold at an extremely high price like $130K per ounce to wipe out the deficit.  This would make the dollar practically worthless.

Option 3, we remain a fiat currency.  According to the Triffin dilemma, we have to continue running trade deficits so the world can accumulate enough dollars to create liquidity.  But over time, confidence in the currency erodes gradually since the dollar is backed less and less by real assets and is backed more by trust.",2025-09-02,0.8659,Positive,[]

Management blamed softer consumer demand, and distributors will likely have to rebalance inventories. Bloomberg Intelligence pointed right at beer sales as the main problem, which is surprising since beer has usually been Constellation’s strongest category.

The bigger question is what this says about the consumer. If people are pulling back on beer, even from a major player like STZ, does that mean discretionary spending is weakening more broadly? Or is this just a company-specific stumble? Either way, the reaction shows just how quickly investors will punish consumer names when demand looks shaky.

Paramount and Activision partner on Call of Duty live-action film,1n6m0en,Puginator,2025-09-02 15:06:24,35,0.8,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n6m0en/paramount_and_activision_partner_on_call_of_duty/,"Call of Duty, one of the most successful video game franchises of all time, will be coming to the big screen with the help of Paramount.

The studio announced Tuesday that it had inked a deal with Microsoft-owned Activision to develop, produce and distribute a live-action feature film based on the first-person shooter game.

“As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true,” David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said in a statement. “From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I’ve spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love.”

Paramount and Activision said they will honor the brand’s “rich narrative and distinctive style” for fans of the video game franchise. Call of Duty has been the best-selling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years, with more than 500 million copies sold globally.

“I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand,” Ellison said.

The deal is yet another major announcement from Paramount since it officially merged with Skydance in early August. Weeks later the studio announced it had signed The Duffer Brothers, the creative team of Matt and Ross Duffer who created Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” to a four-year agreement for feature films, television and streaming projects.

Paramount also bought the U.S. rights to UFC in a $7.7 billion, 7-year deal that starts in 2026.

Ellison said in an open letter shortly after the merger that the company would invest in “high-quality storytelling and cutting-edge technology” to help “define the next era of entertainment.”

Warren Buffett says he is ‘disappointed’ in Kraft Heinz split; shares fall 5%,1n6lf3n,Puginator,2025-09-02 14:44:17,285,0.98,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n6lf3n/warren_buffett_says_he_is_disappointed_in_kraft/,"Warren Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday that he is disappointed in the Kraft Heinz split that unwinds much of the blockbuster merger he masterminded a decade ago.

With a 27.5% stake in the company, Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder. The firm has not touched its shares since the 2015 merger that formed the food conglomerate.

Shares of the company fell more than 3% following Buffett’s comments.

Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick on Tuesday that the merger didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea, but he does not think that taking the company apart will fix its problems.

Greg Abel, who will take reins at Berkshire Hathaway from Buffett at the end of the year, expressed disappointment to Kraft Heinz, according to Buffett.

Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Buffett’s stance on the deal.

The split announced earlier on Tuesday once again separates Kraft Heinz into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables.

Berkshire Hathaway teamed up with private equity firm 3G Capital in 2015 to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the company struggled.

Though it holds a roster of iconic brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, Kraft Heinz saw its U.S. sales slip just a few years after the merger. Health-conscious consumers were buying less packaged food and shopping more around the perimeter of the grocery store. Some analysts also blamed the company’s slump on cost-cutting measures that kept Kraft Heinz from investing in its brands at a time when they needed it most.

In an effort to turn around the business, Kraft Heinz sold off some of its portfolio, like Planters nuts and some of its cheese division. The company has also been investing in some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. In May, Kraft Heinz executives said that the company was weighing strategic changes and potential transactions.

Even as other investors have lost faith in Kraft Heinz, Buffett has stood by the company.

Regarding Berkshire’s future as a Kraft Heinz investor, Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire will do whatever is in the best interest of the firm. If Berkshire is approached to sell its shares, the firm will not accept a block bid unless other shareholders receive the same offer, according to Buffett.

"Musk looks past Tesla sales slump, says 80% of value will come from Optimus",1n6kqml,Puginator,2025-09-02 14:18:21,673,0.91,260,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n6kqml/musk_looks_past_tesla_sales_slump_says_80_of/,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk predicted that Optimus robots, which have yet to hit the market, will eventually make up more than three-quarters of his automaker’s value.

In a post on X on Monday, Musk wrote, ”\~80% of Tesla’s value will be Optimus.” In mid-2024, Musk predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment.

With Tesla in the midst of a multi-quarter sales slump due to competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors, an aging lineup of electric vehicles and Musk’s incendiary political rhetoric and involvement with the Trump administration, the world’s richest person has been trying to convince Wall Street to look to the future.

For Tesla, that dream revolves around a world filled with robotaxis and humanoid robots, powered by artificial intelligence.

“It is important to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI,” Musk said in the company’s second-quarter conference call with analysts in July.

The problem for Tesla is that it’s behind in those key markets.

In robotaxis, Tesla has only recently started tests in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, while Alphabet’s Waymo is live in numerous markets and reached 10 million paid trips in May. Baidu’s Apollo Go is live in China.

Meanwhile, competition in humanoid robots is coming from the likes of Chinese companies like Unitree, which won multiple medals at the World Humanoid Robot Games. Others in the space include Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, 1X and Figure.

Musk said in March that Tesla plans to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year. In its first-quarter shareholder deck, Tesla said it was on target for “builds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories.”

Tesla recently lost the person running the division.

Milan Kovac, Tesla’s vice president of Optimus robotics, announced his departure in June after nine years at the company.

Tesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting.

Both stories are weighing on tech and making people wonder if the “Magnificent Seven” can keep dominating.

Hey guys,

Rough start to the week for a couple of the biggest names in tech.

Nvidia dropped for the second day in a row, down about 1.5% in premarket. The Wall Street Journal reported Alibaba is working on a competing AI chip, and that is not small news. Alibaba’s scale could definitely chip away at Nvidia’s growth story in AI. That weakness also spilled over into the rest of tech on Friday.

Then you have Tesla, which just cannot seem to get traction in India. They have only pulled in a little over 600 orders since launching mid-July. That is a tiny number for a market that is supposed to be massive. By comparison, BYD looks like it is gaining real ground there. Tesla stock slipped about 0.7% on the back of those numbers.

So when you see two of the “Magnificent Seven” take hits at the same time, it makes you pause. Are we looking at cracks in the whole tech trade, or is this just short-term noise that blows over?

Shares of PepsiCo climbed more than 5% in premarket trading. The stock is down about 2% this year, significantly lagging the broader market.

The Paul Singer-founded Elliott’s bet in Pepsi is worth $4 billion, becoming the consumer giant’s top five active investors excluding index funds, according to FactSet. The activist investor sent a presentation and letter to Pepsi’s board of directors Tuesday, detailing a clear agenda focused on restoring business momentum.

“While unfortunate, this disappointing trajectory has created a historic opportunity: With the right mindset and an appropriately ambitious turnaround plan, PepsiCo today represents a rare chance to revitalize a leading global enterprise and unlock significant shareholder value,” Elliott wrote in its letter.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Elliott’s new stake earlier Tuesday.

Elliott said it hopes to work together to help Pepsi build on its legacy of success and achieve its full potential.

Pepsi has been cutting costs and trying to improve its profit margins. The company closed two manufacturing plants for its North American food business during the quarter. Pepsi said it is trying to make its transportation and logistics more efficient. The company is also evaluating how it spends its marketing dollars to make sure it is getting the best return on its investment.

In July, Pepsi reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations, as the company projected that weak North American demand will rebound as strategy changes take hold.

Elliott has a history of activism that has at times yielded strong returns for investors. It’s a large holder of Phillips 66 and Southwest Airlines and has been driving changes at those two companies.

The firm was also famously involved in a 15-year legal battle against the government of Argentina over defaulted bonds. Elliott ended up getting a settlement payment of $2.4 billion, representing a massive return on its initial investment.

Particularly happy with the cloud business (AWS) and their ads business (from my understanding - they have an extremely strong moat and competitive advantage here they have so much data on customer's shopping habits).

**ASML (ASML) - 15%** \- Bought into this position mostly throughout the year by DCAing the dips. My view on this business is that they have a near monopoly in their space which gives them very strong pricing power (which they can leverage to increase their FCF/EPS/Net-Income even in the absence of revenue or volume growth). The stock seems to be beaten down due to risks from losing business in China (and also potential competition from them) but I'm not ***too concerned*** about this. In the worst case they become a global duopoly/oligopoly which is not too shabby.

**Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) - 11%** \- Owned this when I initially started the portfolio.

**Alphabet (GOOGL) - 10%** \- Mostly bought into this throughout the dips in the past few years. Similar to Amazon, a very large set of diversified businesses where they're very dominant in like Youtube, Google Cloud (they compete with AWS, Azure, and OCI and they're third in the race and that's fine with me), Waymo, Ads, and Search. In the worst case, they lose their MOAT in search but from my understanding, the rest of their businesses can make up their current valuation in < 5 years. Anecdotally speaking as a developer, I still use Google search since they added AI overview since it's essentially a combination of an LLM answer + google search together. 

**Meta Platforms (META) - 7.5%** \- The core of my position was from 2022 dips. They're just a cash generating machine from their balance sheet and they have a strong moat in the social media space. Not much to say about this since I bought this at around $120 - but happy to own this since Zucc is so ambitious and has done a good job at growing since IPO.

**Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - 6% -** Bought most of this position back in 2024 when it was in the $110/$120 range. Not much personally to say about this, I like the CEO and think there can be multiple winners in the GPU space.

**Mastercard (MA) - 6% -** They take money off of every card transaction and have a oligopoly. Card payments are still growing globally so I'm just happy to own this. Financials look amazing! 

**Paypal (PYPL) - 5%** \- I mostly bought this because it was very undervalued from a technical standpoint (i.e very high FCF yield). While their FCF/share is going to drastically increase due to their aggressive buybacks - I really do want to sell this entire position since they fundamentally aren't a business with a strong moat and pricing power. The space seems very crowded and in my own personal shopping experience - I almost always use Apple Pay when shopping on mobile and use Shop pay when purchasing online. Looking for a more opportune time to sell it though.

**Canadian Pacific (CP) - 4.5%** \- I bought this mostly due to railroads having very high barriers to entry and typically having strong moat (they have the only railway spanning USA, Canada and Mexico). This hasn't really translated to much FCF/EPS growth though and the company carries alot of debt. Looking to sell this position when it gets to a better valuation.

**Fluence Energy (FLNC) - 4.3%** \- I honestly bought into this purely based on technical analysis in 2024 - low market cap, very high revenue growth, large backlog, and enterprise backing. Currently down -55% on it and it’s my only losing position. I really regret buying into this position and want to get rid of it, haven’t had the stomach to just ear my losses and sell yet. Learned my lesson here to evaluate the business instead of the technicals.

**Reddit (RDDT) - 3%** \- I own this since this is a platform that I use a lot (in addition to Youtube). The financial growth seems very impressive and the business/platform is very good. I’m debating on whether to buy more into it but valuation makes me slightly afraid, though it always seems like great businesses always trade at high valuations and still end up compounding long germ.

**Nebius Group (NBIS) - 2%** \- Honestly just my gamble stock.

**Remaining <1% are FICO, RIVN, and SNOW.**

PLTR will be like TSLA was at the beginning of this presidency,1n66n5d,CoronaEraXpertTrader,2025-09-02 01:29:21,0,0.24,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n66n5d/pltr_will_be_like_tsla_was_at_the_beginning_of/,"Listen up.

Palantir is getting ready to launch. Let’s unravel this now. 

- Peter Thiel is a co-founder of of PLTR

- Thiel and JD vance have been close comrades for more than a DECADE, with much business done.

- Orange man appears to be unwell, with many twitter news outlets depicting orange man looking not so energetic, and Vance himself stated “he’s ready to be president” (while praising orange man’s health). Read between the lines: he is, infact, not in good health. 

- If orange man dies, Vance becomes president. This propels PLTR to be the president’s stock, just as TSLA was at the beginning of this presidency. Tesla kept going up, until tensions between trump and musk were getting bad.

Thus, PLTR should hit new highs and above in the next 6 months. ",2025-09-02,-0.4827,Negative,"['PLTR', 'JD', 'PLTR', 'TSLA', 'PLTR']"
"Powell at Jackson Hole may have underestimated the destructive impact of tariffs on inflation, the economy, and jobs.",1n63agc,AppropriateRefuse590,2025-09-01 22:52:20,512,0.75,256,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n63agc/powell_at_jackson_hole_may_have_underestimated/,"Just thinking about Powell’s Jackson Hole speech makes me furious.
The whole thing reads like he was covering for Trump.

First came his affirmation of inflation control, basically downplaying current inflation risks  in reality, PCE is trending upward, PPI is surging.

Most importantly, he framed tariff-driven inflation as “usually one-off” right at the start. The possibility that tariff inflation could be persistent and requires monitoring was left until the very end  giving the market the impression that tariffs’ damage to inflation is limited. This massively underestimates the fact that tariffs are not simply “collect 10% more, firms raise prices exactly 10% for a short time.” In a competitive industry, pricing decisions are shaped simultaneously by peers’ pricing, consumer tolerance, and whether intense competition forces firms to absorb costs. Without any anchor, both the scale and the duration of price hikes become completely unpredictable. From various reports, it’s clear many firms still don’t even know how to price.

He emphasized downside risks to employment and said policy would adjust  the source of the rate cut signal. But he never explained why employment is falling. The whole speech gave the impression that rate cuts can rescue jobs  completely ignoring the fact that many reports point out firms are hesitant to hire precisely because of Trump’s chaotic tariffs. On top of that, Trump’s removal of 1.4 million immigrants from construction and hospitality has also significantly hit nonfarm payrolls.

Right now GDP is sending signals completely opposite to nonfarm employment.

The entire speech brushed off the destructive nature of tariffs, leaving the impression that rate cuts could solve it. Even if the economy is slowing, I completely oppose rate cuts. Powell is drastically underestimating the damage tariffs inflict on global supply chains. Once even a single chain collapses under tariff pressure, the shock will ultimately transmit back to the U.S. And the chilling effect on domestic investment could also be significant.

Most importantly, all of this is unknown. We are now facing the largest trade war in history, with no sufficient historical data to gauge the impact. The Fed’s most rational choice is to preserve ammunition, wait for enough time and data, and intervene swiftly and effectively only when a situation arises that rate cuts can genuinely fix. But if they waste all their ammunition now, at a time when the outlook is uncertain and the data contradictory, then when the real crisis hits, the Fed will have nothing left but to lie flat and give up.

Powell should have used Jackson Hole to stress the destructive nature of tariffs and the Fed’s caution  to make the market understand where responsibility truly lies and what the Fed can and cannot do. Instead, he left the market thinking tariffs could be solved by rate cuts. An economic storm triggered by trade policy must be handled by the culprit itself. This is a severe misallocation of responsibility.

Summary: The Fed should prepare for the worst rather than speculate optimistically.

Defining tariffs as one-time events is utterly absurd; the Fed should not speculate on events with no historical data.

Even if they truly were one-time, this behavior is still highly negligent, as it relies entirely on luck.


By the way, I predict the probability of a September rate cut to be between 40–60%, and the probability for an October rate cut will be slightly higher.

"Gold nears records, silver breaks $40: safe haven or overhyped rally?",1n5wmyn,Optionslab,2025-09-01 18:28:44,333,0.94,144,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n5wmyn/gold_nears_records_silver_breaks_40_safe_haven_or/,"TL;DR: Silver just broke $40 for the first time since 2011. Gold is creeping toward record highs. Fed rate cut bets and risk-off sentiment are fueling the run, and miners are ripping too.

Silver crossing $40 is a huge breakout. Last time it was here was over a decade ago. Gold is right behind it, inching closer to fresh records.

Investors are clearly shifting out of riskier plays and into metals. The “flight to safety” trade is on.

The Fed angle is also massive. Markets now see an 87% chance of a September cut, and Powell sounded a little softer at Jackson Hole. That combo makes the setup really favorable for gold and silver.

And it is not just the metals. Miners are outperforming, with gold and silver names running hard.

So the big question: is this the start of a real safe haven cycle, or is the rally already overextended?

Would you be buying metals here, or waiting for a pullback before jumping in?",2025-09-01,0.7994,Positive,"['TL', 'DR']"

* Business travel is back, there seems to be a trend that will normalize business travel back to pre covid era, and this was mentioned by United airlines CEO, Delta Ceo, and also Frontier .
* Business seats and Preimum seats are in demand, as more Americans prefer to pay 500$ \~ 1000$ more for a premium seat in an international flight or less in domestic. in general there are more rich people like all the diamond hands that bought palantir for 10$.
* 2026 Year of the world cup, maybe some of you dont know but the world cup is a huge deal all over the world, and this will bring huge huge amount of traffic during Q2 and Q4, flights will be fully booked with priced jacked up like crazy, there will be tons of Rich Europens and Rich arabs flying all over. This effect will produce a very high guidance.
* Consolidationin of the airlines market - Just in friday spirit airlines announced another chapter 11 bankruptcy, they even sent this message of bankruptcy to all of theyre customers, while they didn't ceased operations no customer will take a chance flying with them anytime soon, and the odds of spirit survivng this second chapter 11 is low. So there will be one less airline meaning more demand and higher prices, if you remmber there was also a merger between Alaska airlines and Hawian that took place last year. so the trend is clear less airlines and more mergers/bankruptcy.
* DAL p/e is 9 and UAL is 10 both airlines carry decent amount of debt, some are correlated to the leasing of jets and some is pure debt so take it as a risk. The margins of both airlines is in the 5% but there is a chance this can double or atleast get to 7%.

My line of thinking is that should Trump face any incapacitation/25th/death, then markets will gap up, with Bitcoin being the proxy if markets are closed. Rationale is that Vance (backed by Thiel and Musk) would not be keen on tariffs and likely to cancel the bulk of them. 

I see the following moves occurring over the few weeks following any such event:

- Treasury yields fall given the cessation of tariffs (less inflationary pressure) 
- Jobs market shows some strength again (hiring as businesses have less uncertainty) 
- Tesla up by 20% or more as Musk will be a huge beneficiary of any Vance presidency
- Indices up 5% or so given less Taco (or none at all)

Won't touch on the chaos that will ensue by all the cabinet members (think death of Stalin), but safe to assume the hyenas will be out.

* **SCHO (Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF):** Invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 years. This provides the most safety and lowest interest rate risk of the group (except SGOV), but with a lower potential yield. 
* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):** Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **TIPS (iShares TIPS Bond ETF)** generally performs well in an Inflationary environment as its principal and interest payments increase with inflation.
* ***SGOV*** **(iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF)** for people who want to park their money and earn an interest rate that is usually higher than a CD without the restrictions of waiting for maturity.

**What is your strategy for the Bond ETFs in light of the probable upcoming rate cut?**

KSS still a bargain?,1n3xzp0,lies_are_comforting,2025-08-30 10:12:23,10,0.68,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3xzp0/kss_still_a_bargain/,"How did you all feel about KSS when it was $6? Well, here’s how I felt and I bet a lot of you felt the same way… 

I looked at that $6 price and felt confident that it wasn’t going to go much lower than that. I remember thinking: 

“a 50 % drop is way unlikelier than a 50 % jump. For $3 to happen they would have to declare bankruptcy and there’s no way that’s happening. For $12 to happen they just need to improve things marginally.”

Fast forward to today. Does the same logic still apply? I’m not so sure. A 50 % drop would mean going back to $7.5. Would that require unthinkable devastation such as bankruptcy? No. All it takes might just be disappointing Q3 signaling that the turnaround is going to take much longer than Q2 results had us believe. They said July revenue was flat and that the first month of Q3, August, was going great so far. For Q2 earnings they delivered on all expectations and then some. Hard to find anything that wasn’t positive other than the ongoing decline in revenue of course but that was very, very, expected. You don’t go from -5 % expected to +1 % or whatever. 

We’re riding a 150 % jump since April. 150 % in four months. Everything is different now. There are less Neil Saunders out there now. Most analysts doubled their price targets. People now expect Kohl’s to succeed. They no longer expect Kohl’s to go bankrupt. The road from $6 to $15 didn’t require much good news. Kohl’s just needed to show everyone that it wasn’t a dying business. The road from $15 to $30 or even $25 is going to be much harder. They now no longer need to just show they can survive but also that they can compete and win vs peers. 

“Blah blah de minimis exemption ending.” Bro, people that sat on their couch at home buying cheap China stuff on their phones aren’t going to get up and drive to Kohl’s instead. They’ll do the next most convenient and cheap thing which is to order from Amazon, Walmart, Fashion Nova, Zara, ASOS or H&M. Or, Chinese e commerce retailers will find a way to stay to adjust and remain the cheapest option. 

“Blah blah real estate worth $10 billion.” Doesn’t matter at all. Kohl’s is a retail business not a real estate business. In fact, the Q2 results just made the real estate deep value play way more unlikely because the ‘dying retailer’ threat now seems unthinkable, and Kohl’s won’t ever utilize its real estate for income unless it’s a matter of survival. 

KSS isn’t on a 50 % discount anymore. It was at $6. Currently, you’re paying regular price. Odds of it doubling in price are worse than odds of it halving. $7.5 is more likely than $30. 

I’m a shareholder and have been since January. So what am I going to do? I’m waiting for $20 because I still can’t get over not selling on Meme Tuesday July 22 when the stock hit $21. 

I put my faith in what Cramer said yesterday: “[KSS] looks to be a meme stock. It’s up very big. . . .they had news, the quarter was just okay. Just okay.”",2025-08-30,0.8757,Positive,"['KSS', 'ASOS', 'KSS', 'KSS']"

Is the 'Magnificent Seven' Era Ending? Why Capital Might Be Flowing from Big Tech to Small/Mid-Caps (and Why September Matters),1n3io7o,Optionslab,2025-08-29 20:42:16,0,0.24,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3io7o/is_the_magnificent_seven_era_ending_why_capital/,"**TL;DR:** High valuations and concentration risk in big tech are pushing investors to rotate into smaller, undervalued names. We may be entering a true ""stock pickers' market,"" and September’s historical weakness could accelerate the shift.

The market feels like it’s at an inflection point. For the past few years, the “Magnificent Seven” have carried the weight of the S&P 500, but cracks are starting to show. Capital could be moving toward smaller, more overlooked companies, and here’s why.

**The Big Tech Exodus**  
Some of the largest names in tech are showing real weakness. Oracle, Nvidia, Broadcom, Tesla, and even Meta have all stumbled recently. High valuations and concentration risk are the two big drivers here. With so much of the market tied to just a handful of stocks, portfolios have become less diversified and more fragile. The unwind of the “big tech AI trade” seems to be underway.

**The Rise of a Stock Picker’s Market**  
Money leaving mega-cap tech isn’t disappearing, it’s looking for new homes. We may be entering a genuine stock picker’s market where smaller, undervalued companies shine. Healthcare is one sector to watch. Merck looks well-positioned to benefit from a strong economy, while Biogen, despite recent weakness, could see upside if interest rates come down. Investors seem more open to considering mid-caps and overlooked names outside of the tech bubble.

**The September Effect**  
September has historically been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500. That seasonal weakness is now combining with sector-specific cracks, especially in tech. If investors de-risk, this rotation could accelerate, sending more capital into less crowded areas of the market. Volatility may pick up, and those prepared to hunt for value could benefit.

**Conclusion**  
Between stretched tech valuations, concentration risk, and seasonal headwinds, the “Magnificent Seven” era might be losing steam. The bigger question is whether this truly marks the start of a broader rotation.

Are you shifting your portfolio toward smaller or mid-cap names? Which companies do you think are set to benefit most from this rotation?",2025-08-29,0.8917,Positive,"['TL', 'DR', 'AI']"

>Trump cabinet officials told a federal appeals court that ruling the president’s global tariffs illegal would seriously harm US foreign policy, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning of “dangerous diplomatic embarrassment.”
>
>The administration on Friday filed statements by Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. The court is expected to decide soon whether President Donald Trump exceeded his authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 emergency powers law.
>
>Bessent, Lutnick and Rubio’s statements were filed in support of a request that any ruling against the administration be immediately put on hold until the US Supreme Court issues a final decision. Failing to do so would have “devastating and dire consequences,” Lutnick said.
>
>During July 31 oral arguments before the Federal Circuit, the administration’s claims of broad tariff power were met with skepticism, suggesting the judges might side with separate challenges filed by a group of small businesses and a coalition of Democratic-led states. Friday’s filing seems to suggest the administration is worried about precisely that outcome.

It seems likely at this point that the tariffs will at least be paused until the supreme court ultimately makes the final decision

And to be honest I was quite surprised by the numbers.

46 billion USD in revenue per quarter. And 42.1 billion of it purely from datacenters related business. I.e. selling GPUs primarily. I know they sell NICs and other stuff too. But a big chunk of that money came from GPUs. And that was for a single quarter. Not even 1 whole year.

To put that 46 billion USD number into perspective. Twitter placed an order 100K H100 GPUs one year ago if I remember correctly. 100K x 25K(per GPU) \~= 2.5 billion USD. And that itself was a giant order. And once you spend 2.5 billion dollars on GPUs, there is no chance in hell the company will turn around and buy more GPUs for another 2 to 3 years. Unless the next generation of GPUs show such tremendous performance improvement that they are compelled to buy more GPUs. And let's be honest this is not 1970s that processors can be optimized that much in a year or 2. GPUs are reaching a saturation point in my opinion. Once you buy a light bulb you won't buy a new one unless the current one burns out.

There is a thermal upper limit to how many MOSFETs you can cram on a die. And even the MOSFETs themselves can only be shrunk so much. 4nm feature size MOSFET is an incredibly small MOSFET. An atom itself is like 0.1nm. The MOSFETs we are making today barely have 2000 or so atoms in them if I am not wrong. All of these conclusions arise from Moore's law dying a slow death.

Better architecture is the way these processor manufacturers were able to eek out more performance gains without a die shrink. But at this point we are looking at a 25 year old processor manufacturing company. Whatever trivial optimizations they could make to their GPUs have already been made in my opinion.

In-spite of all of this, these people are selling about 1.68 million H100 equivalents every quarter? And not only that, the next quarter's guidance is about 13% higher than this quarter! And people have priced that into the stock price already. Their PE is about 50! Their stock holders are willing to pay 50 times the annual profit the company makes. And if the company doesn't make that much profit, i.e. sell about roughly 1.9 million H100s next quarter or whatever is the latest high performance GPU, their stock will crash.

Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China,1n3dv7e,chinese__investor,2025-08-29 17:35:24,362,0.92,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3dv7e/alibaba_unveils_homegrown_ai_chip_to_replace/,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

I May Have Been Wrong About Enovix,1n3678c,Key-League4228,2025-08-29 12:34:08,2,0.54,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n3678c/i_may_have_been_wrong_about_enovix/,"I was an early investor in Enovix that had soured on the stock with the idea that slow adoption has doomed this upstart battery manufacturer. Yesterday, Polaris Battery Lab released the results of their independent testing of the Enovix AI-1 battery. The results are stunning; Not only does it exceed expectations for charge time and cycle life, it achieves 919 Wh/L volumetric energy density, which is among the highest ever reported for a smartphone battery. It caused me to take a second look at what this company brings to the table. It brought me to realize that the investment case for Enovix isn't just about a better lithium-ion battery today; it's about a company well-positioned to compete in the next generation of battery technology. The most compelling aspect of Enovix isn't their current chemistry, but rather their manufacturing expertise and proprietary architecture.

**The Bear Case**

* **Long Time to Market:** Enovix has been in development for a long time, and delays have created doubt about their ability to scale manufacturing. The company must prove it can execute its manufacturing ramp-up and achieve a cost structure that makes its high-performance batteries appealing to a wider market, before competitive progression obsoletes their advantages.
* **Erosive AI Effect:** AI promises to significantly accelerate the discovery of new battery chemistries by replacing the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of trial and error with rapid, data-driven computational analysis. It does this primarily by sifting through millions of potential material combinations, predicting their properties, and pinpointing the most promising candidates for physical testing. This has an erosive effect on all patent portfolios but is especially caustic to pre-revenue upstarts that are attempting to introduce disruptive technologies. Again, it begs the question of whether they can beat the clock and achieve an early mover advantage.
* **Cost and Commercial Adoption:** The lack of widespread commercial adoption to date, particularly with major smartphone and consumer electronics OEMs, raises questions about their manufacturing costs and whether they can compete on price. Without publicly available cost data, it's difficult to verify their competitiveness.

**The Bull Case**

* **Architectural Synergy with ASSBs**: The stacked geometry and Integrated Constraint System that Enovix uses today are not just features, they are solutions to problems that plague ASSBs. Solid-state batteries often require high pressure to ensure good contact between the solid electrolyte and the electrodes. Enovix has already solved this engineering challenge with its patented constraint system, which provides the necessary stack pressure to handle electrode expansion.
* **Safety and Thermal Management**: ASSBs are not immune to thermal runaway, especially under physical stress. Enovix's BrakeFlow™ technology is an in-cell safety feature that could provide a critical redundancy for future ASSBs, which may still face internal short-circuit risks. This is a valuable piece of intellectual property that could be licensed or integrated into future solid-state designs.
* **A ""Placeholder"" Strategy**: Enovix management touts that they are chemistry agnostic. This phrasing allows the marketplace to *eventually* understand their message without revealing their competitive game plan. Enovix's current lithium-ion chemistry is just a placeholder. The company has accumulated a massive amount of expertise (and patent portfolio) focused on the manufacture and physical architecture of the battery rather than a specific chemical recipe. Enovix isn't just a silicon-anode company; it's an advanced battery company, that has long been secretly positioning itself for a seamless transition to new materials, like solid-state electrolytes, when they become commercially viable.

**The AI Revolution: A Catalyst for Enovix**

While AI may pose the aforementioned threats to Enovix, the AI revolution is proving to be a crucial and timely addition to the bull case. The demands of on-device AI are pushing battery power consumption to new heights. The AI-1 battery is positioned to be a first-mover in this segment, offering a substantial increase in energy density and power output. Enovix has given enough cost information to extrapolate an approximate unit cost of around $10. If Enovix can command a premium for this performance, it could generate the revenue needed to fund expansion and find themselves coincidentally (by design) in the right place at the right time. I believe Enovix is the sleeper that could become a major player in both today's and tomorrow's battery markets.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

On paper, the report looked really strong. Sales and profit both beat expectations. AI server demand is exploding, and Dell raised its forecast from “above $15 billion” to $20 billion for the year. They also bumped full-year revenue guidance higher. Even the PC business, which has been struggling, managed to grow a little.

So why the dip? A few things could be at play. Dell’s stock has been running hot lately, so this might just be profit-taking. It could also be that Wall Street was secretly looking for even bigger numbers. And since NVIDIA was down earlier in the day, the whole AI hardware space cooled off a bit.

The big picture still looks solid though. Dell is clearly carving out a role in AI infrastructure, and that $20 billion server forecast shows real demand. The key questions are whether margins hold up and whether the PC side stays steady.

Feels like the stock got punished more for sky-high expectations than for anything Dell actually did wrong.

Safety stocks and etfs: The Buffett method that ensures success,1n2imtr,daxter_101,2025-08-28 17:30:12,0,0.36,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n2imtr/safety_stocks_and_etfs_the_buffett_method_that/,"After investing for over 2 years now, I learned one big lesson which is there is no such thing as safety in the stock market. It doesn’t matter if you invest in etfs or heavily institutional stocks that represent over 90% of the float. The one lesson I learned is you just need to invest in stocks you have extreme conviction on for the future and good fundamentals. The only time I personally made money was when I followed the Buffett rule which consists of 3 steps

Step 1. You use a product of the company. That sounds easy enough but when you actually invest in stocks how many are tied to your daily in life in some way indirectly or directly

Step 2. Do you see growth 5, 10, 15 years out. Seasoned investors don’t time the market, they’re in the market for long stretches which then compounds

Step 3. Ignore emotional or outside noise. Every investor loses money at some point. It then becomes a question of how much resilience you have to hold on. In order to have the strength to hold on, you need extreme conviction of the stock and its growth. That’s what separates the top 1% of investors and the remaining 99%

Nike to lay off about 1% of corporate staff in its latest effort to refocus the business,1n2hvpv,Puginator,2025-08-28 17:02:26,210,0.96,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n2hvpv/nike_to_lay_off_about_1_of_corporate_staff_in_its/,"Nike is planning another round of layoffs as part of CEO Elliott Hill’s efforts to realign the business and get it back to growth, CNBC has learned. 

The cuts will impact less than 1% of Nike’s corporate staff. It’s unclear how many jobs will be impacted. Nike’s EMEA and Converse businesses will not be impacted. 

“As we shared in Q4 earnings, NIKE, Inc. is in the midst of a realignment. The moves we’re making are about setting ourselves up to win and create the next great chapter for NIKE,” the company told CNBC in a statement. “This new formation is built to put sport and sport culture back at the center, to connect more deeply with the athlete and the consumer, and to give us the space to create what only NIKE can.”

Last February, Nike announced plans to lay off 2% of its staff, or more than 1,500 jobs, as part of a broader restructuring. The latest round of layoffs is part of Hill’s efforts to change how teams are structured within the corporation. 

Under former CEO John Donahoe, Nike changed the way its business was segmented. Instead of being divided by sport, it was divided into women’s, men’s and kid’s as part of a broader effort to grow its lifestyle business. 

Some critics say that adjustment was among the reasons that Nike’s innovation pipeline fell apart as the company focused on lifestyle products geared to a wide range of consumers, instead of being directed at athletes. 

Hill, a longtime Nike veteran, is now undoing that work so the business is squarely focused on sports and culture. After Hill shared his vision in June, leaders were identified in July to head the new teams, the company said, adding a “small number” of staff will depart as a result of the shifts.

In a memo to staff, Nike said as part of the changes, some staff will take on a new position or level, report to a new manager or join a new team.

Staff will learn if they’re impacted during conversations by Sept. 8. The majority of the new roles will take effect on Sept. 21.

“To make space for these conversations, corporate employees based in an office location in the U.S. and Canada will work remotely next week, unless otherwise informed by your leader,” the memo said.

Since taking the helm of the world’s largest sportswear brand, Hill has been on a mission to reverse an ongoing decline in sales, reignite innovation and win back wholesale partners. 

When announcing fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in June, Nike said it expects its sales and profit declines to moderate in the quarters ahead, indicating the worst is now behind it and the fruits of its turnaround could come sooner than expected. In a call with analysts at the time, Hill hinted at the realignment that’s now starting to materialize. 

“Instead of a men’s, women’s and kids construct, Nike, Jordan, and Converse teams will now come to work every day with a mission to create the most innovative and coveted product, footwear, apparel and accessories for the specific athletes they serve,” said Hill.

Hill said the company would organize into “sport-obsessed teams” which would “drive a relentless flow of innovative product across all three of the brands.”

Nvidia CEO Huang says bringing Blackwell AI chip to China ‘is a real possibility’,1n1y5cm,Puginator,2025-08-28 00:37:27,317,0.97,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n1y5cm/nvidia_ceo_huang_says_bringing_blackwell_ai_chip/,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said there’s a “real possibility” the company brings its advanced Blackwell processor to China as he urges the U.S. government to open up access for American chipmakers.

He also predicted the artificial intelligence market in the world’s second-biggest economy will grow 50% next year.

“The opportunity for us to bring Blackwell to the China market is a real possibility,” Huang said on Wednesday in a call for Nvidia’s latest quarterly results. “We just have to keep advocating the importance of American tech companies to be able to lead and win the AI race, and help make the American tech stack the global standard.”

Huang personally visited the White House in July and August to secure export licenses for Nvidia’s current-generation chip for Chinese AI, called the H20. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal in which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of China sales of the H20 going to the U.S. government.

After the meeting, Trump said he was open to making a deal for Blackwell chips, which is Nvidia’s latest AI technology that currently comprises the majority of its data center revenue.

Huang has said that it is better for Chinese AI developers to use Nvidia’s chips rather than force them to use homegrown Chinese options by preventing exports, which could incentivize the Chinese tech industry to catch up.

If Nvidia were to release a Blackwell chip in China, it could spur a large amount of sales as Chinese AI developers opt for the most powerful chips available. Nvidia would have to modify its Blackwell chips for the U.S. market to make them slower in certain aspects in order to comply with U.S. export regulations.

“The Blackwell is super-duper advanced. I wouldn’t make a deal with that,” Trump said in August, before adding that it was possible to make a deal for a “somewhat enhanced in a negative way” version of Blackwell.

Huang’s bullish comments on Wednesday come after the company reported second-quarter year-over-year revenue growth of 56% to $54 billion, despite not selling a single H20 chip to China during the quarter. Nvidia said it released $180 million in H20 inventory to a customer outside of China, which accounted for $650 million in sales.

Nvidia said it is not counting on any H20 sales in the October quarter as part of its forecast for $54 billion in revenue, but that the company could sell between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 chips, depending on the geopolitical environment.

“If we had more orders, we can build more,” Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said on the call with analysts.

Nvidia said that while it had received some licenses after the meeting with Trump, the U.S. government has yet to publish official regulations outlining how its cut of sales will work.

“USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement,” Kress said.

Huang told analysts that China is the second-largest AI market in the world.

“The China market I’ve estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year, if we were able to address it with competitive products,” Huang said. “And if it’s $50 billion this year, you would expect it to grow, say, 50% per year.”

Recent reports have indicated that the Chinese government is encouraging AI developers to use homegrown chips over those from Nvidia.

“We’re still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do,” Kress said.

Intel warns shareholders that the US government's 10% stake could hurt company's international sales,1n1xk7a,lOo_ol,2025-08-28 00:10:04,1263,0.97,141,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n1xk7a/intel_warns_shareholders_that_the_us_governments/,"[https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-warns-shareholders-that-the-us-governments-10-percent-stake-could-hurt-companys-international-sales](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-warns-shareholders-that-the-us-governments-10-percent-stake-could-hurt-companys-international-sales)

One of Intel's biggest concerns is its dependence on foreign markets: In fiscal 2024, the company earned 76% of its $53.1 billion revenue outside the United States, a slight decline from the previous year, but still the lion's share. Sales to entities in China contributed 29% of Intel's total revenue, followed by the U.S. with 24.5%, Singapore with 19.2%, and Taiwan with 14.7%. Now that the U.S. government is Intel's largest shareholder, the chipmaker is directly linked to Trump's unpredictable trade and tariff policies, which could unsettle overseas customers and governments. 

""Having the U.S. Government as a significant stockholder of the Company could subject the Company to additional regulations, obligations or restrictions, such as foreign subsidy laws or otherwise, in other countries,"" a statement by Intel reads. 

In addition, the filing highlights the possibility of negative reactions from investors, suppliers, employees, and competitors. Intel went as far as to mention that lawsuits or political scrutiny could arise and warned that a change in the U.S. political leadership could alter or even undo parts of the agreement, which would cause further consequences.

""Among other things, there could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors,"" the statement says. 

Intel acknowledged it had not finished evaluating the full financial, tax, and accounting effects of the deal, so further issues may arise. 

The agreement between Intel and the U.S. government, signed on August 22, 2025, includes two funding steps. The first is roughly $5.7 billion, which represents accelerated payments from Intel's earlier arrangement with the Commerce Department under the CHIPS Act. The second is about $3.2 billion, which is linked to the CHIPS Act 'Secure Enclave' initiative for critical chips for aerospace and defense, and will be provided as conditions are met. Together, this funding package gives Intel immediate cash ($5.7 billion) and aligns future payments with government programs.

In return, Intel will issue up to 433 million shares of stock to the U.S. government. Roughly 275 million shares will be given out once the first batch of money arrives, while around 159 million shares will sit in escrow and be released only as the Secure Enclave funds are transferred. However, if Intel does not receive all of the expected Secure Enclave money, half of the corresponding shares will still go to the government (no matter how many contracts are signed and for how much), while the other half will be cancelled.",2025-08-28,0.9559,Positive,"['CHIPS', 'CHIPS']"

**Revenue**: Revenue of $46.7 billion, up 6% from Q1 and up 56% from a year ago

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 27, 2025, of $46.7 billion, up 6% from the previous quarter and up 56% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Data Center revenue grew 17% sequentially.

There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter. NVIDIA benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory, from approximately $650 million in unrestricted H20 sales to a customer outside of China.

Data Center revenue for the second quarter was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew 17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell revenue across all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.

Data Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20 sales. Networking revenue was $7.3 billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.

**Outlook**  
NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:

* Revenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company has not assumed any H20 shipments to China in the outlook.
* GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The company continues to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in the mid-70% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth is expected to be in the high-30% range.
* GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.
* GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.",2025-08-27,0.8689,Positive,"['NVDA', 'AI', 'XDR', 'AI', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'GAAP']"

"Google has eliminated 35% of managers overseeing small teams in past year, exec says",1n1oftl,Puginator,2025-08-27 18:06:35,1791,0.98,218,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n1oftl/google_has_eliminated_35_of_managers_overseeing/,"Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

“Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to an audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. “So a lot of fast progress there,”

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, “internal barriers” and Google’s culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

“When we look across our entire leadership population, that’s mangers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in, reiterating the need for the company “to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount.”

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts “a little further.” Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.

Short squeeze potential on volatility due to hedge funds short vol as we enter higher risk month,1n1m4me,MirthandMystery,2025-08-27 16:41:15,0,0.35,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n1m4me/short_squeeze_potential_on_volatility_due_to/,"Apparently hedge funds are trying to make up for April losses by shorting vol. If you've ever traded it you know what can happen and this set up presents a good opportunity for traders willing to accept risk. 

We haven't seen a sharp VIX spike since April but it won't take much for this to rip again if shorts have to cover. 

Factors that can create a short term spike is Nvidia meeting expectations or not beating as much as people want. That gives the market an excuse to fade a little off these ATHs. Also heading into end of month we tend to see selling and rebalancing. If it's a blowout earnings number the VIX will drop, temporarily- ideal time to trade for a flip or buy and hold. 

Into Sept is optimism about a rate cut that can refuel a tech lead rally, sending vol lower up to the FED announcement but note selling usually occurs around Rosh Hashanah and vol spikes again.

Nvidia's Earnings Day: Beyond the Numbers What Could Threaten the AI Boom?,1n1l7x7,Optionslab,2025-08-27 16:07:53,151,0.89,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n1l7x7/nvidias_earnings_day_beyond_the_numbers_what/,"Everyone’s watching Nvidia today.  
The company reports earnings, and it’s easily the biggest market event. The options market is pricing in just a \~6% move (the smallest in two years), signaling strong confidence. Nvidia is already up 35% year-to-date and remains a cornerstone of the “Mag Seven.”

But instead of focusing only on the near-term beat/miss, I’m thinking about the bigger question: *how sustainable is the AI boom powering Nvidia’s growth?*

Here are the risks I’m watching:

1. China Conundrum Analysts’ revenue forecasts diverge sharply because of uncertainty around Chinese sales. With China pushing for chip self-sufficiency and banning certain H20 purchases, volatility is high. Nvidia even took an $8B Q4 write-down tied to these chips. Can it navigate this geopolitical minefield?
2. Hyperscaler Indigestion Tech giants like Meta plan to spend $100B+ on data centers next year. This spending spree drives Nvidia’s growth but if hyperscalers overbuild, demand for GPUs could slow sharply down the road.
3. Energy Bottlenecks Running AI data centers consumes staggering amounts of electricity. Over the next 3–5 years, higher energy prices and even grid shortages could emerge as real bottlenecks. Can infrastructure scale fast enough to support AI adoption?
4. Competition & Growth Slowdown Nvidia’s GPU dominance is expected to last through 2029, but AMD is closing the gap with better software and ecosystem plays. Meanwhile, revenue growth is projected to slow from 250%+ last year to \~56% this year, then 28% and 15% in the years ahead. Is this simply natural maturation or a sign of rising competition?

TL;DR: Nvidia’s earnings are the headline, but the real story is the durability of the AI boom. Key risks: China sales uncertainty, potential overbuilding by hyperscalers, energy constraints, and a slowdown in growth as competition heats up.

What do you think beyond tonight’s earnings, what’s the biggest long-term risk or opportunity for Nvidia and AI?",2025-08-27,0.9899,Positive,"['AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'GPU', 'AMD', 'TL', 'DR', 'AI', 'AI']"

I’m currently trading with Interactive Brokers and sometimes analyzing via TradingView.
The problem is – neither of them offers a proper Android home screen widget to just keep track of my tickers and see real-time market data at a glance.

I’m on a Samsung Galaxy phone (Android), and what I’d really like is something simple: a widget that shows my watchlist/tickers and updates during the day, without needing to open an app every time.

For those of you in a similar situation – how do you solve this?
Do you use third-party apps, custom widgets, or maybe Google Finance / Yahoo Finance?
Any recommendations or setups that worked well for you would be super helpful.

Thanks in advance!",2025-08-27,0.9223,Positive,[]

**Joby** is going premium: long range, high-speed, intercity “sky limo” vibes. Great for upscale travelers, but rides might be infrequent and route dependent

**Archer,** on the other hand, is focused on high volume urban commuting. The Midnight aircraft is built for shorter hops, repeatable trips & dense city routes. It’s less glam, more practical basically a city cab that flies. The advantage? Potentially quicker path to monetization since urban commuters are everywhere

**Investors might ask:** Do you bet on the exclusive long haul experience, or the workhorse that could scale fast in city skies?

Personally, the urban taxi model feels like it could get people flying sooner rather than later

Is nonfarm payroll really an appropriate indicator for assessing whether employment needs a rate cut to stimulate it?,1n15p4d,AppropriateRefuse590,2025-08-27 02:50:29,47,0.75,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n15p4d/is_nonfarm_payroll_really_an_appropriate/,"Since Trump took office, he has deported a considerable number of immigrants, and the labor lost due to these deportations can be considered permanently gone. Moreover, some immigrants used to work two to three jobs

Not to mention that with Trump imposing one tariff today and another tomorrow, this clearly creates enormous uncertainty for businesses. In such a situation, companies are more likely to wait and see rather than hire.

If nonfarm payrolls cannot strip out the gaps caused by these structural and political issues, any economic decisions based on them will be highly distorted.


A rate cut can’t fix Trump harassing other countries and businesses like a meddling clown.

No, a rate cut can’t make those permanently lost immigrants contribute to employment data again.


The Federal Reserve should focus on things that monetary policy can directly influence.

Instead of being dragged into trouble by Trump everywhere and ending up having to shoulder the blame for recession and inflation.

Bayrou argues around 44 billion euros ($51 billion) in budget cuts are needed to reduce the French deficit, which totaled 5.8% of GDP in 2024, with his proposals including freezing welfare and pension spending, as well as tax brackets, at 2025 levels.

Erik Nelson, head of G10 FX strategy at Wells Fargo, called the outlook for French assets “not great”, but said the outcome for Bayrou’s government was not a foregone conclusion.

“I think part of the issue here is that European equities, the euro itself, have been a very popular momentum trade throughout the year. What we’re seeing in the last couple of days has been a little bit of unwind.”

“I don’t know that Bayrou is definitely out. There’s still some uncertainty there. He’s got a lot of things he can offer the opposition”, Nelson continued, including that the French minister could back away from a contentious proposal to cut two public holidays.

News: [Trump Removes Fed Governor Lisa Cook Effective Immediately](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-26/trump-removes-fed-governor-lisa-cook-effective-immediately?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**OPEN (Open Door Technologies)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&p=d)\-Rallied with the stock surging nearly 40% on Friday, it seems like it happened mainly due to the rate cut news (and thus real estate prices boom). Interested in the $6 level, more short biased and currently short $6 calls expiring EOW- I'm mainly thinking of covering today/tomorrow if we break $5. Premarket seems to be biased for towards sellers as well. Overall, the stock is pretty liquid so I don't have trouble getting the size I want, especially in shares. Interested in the last few hours of trading like yesterday because of the selloff. 

[**W (Wayfair)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=W&p=d)/[**RH (Restoration Hardware)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RH&p=d)/[**WSM (Williams-Sonoma)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WSM&p=d)\-Trump announced upcoming tariffs on imported furniture, sending shares of W/RH/WSM lower on Friday. Tariffs are expected to be finalized within 50 days. We saw a pretty decently sized bounce yesterday after Friday's AH selloff, watching for continuation today. I'm mainly interested in W, but ultimately trying to be agile in both directions because I don't have any strong opinion on this. Companies sourcing heavily from overseas are at greatest risk, (Wayfair sources heavily from the cursory research I've done). Mainly interested in the $70 level for W. 

[**CSX (CSX Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CSX&p=d)\-Buffett/BRK clarified that no merger talks are underway, CSX states that they're open to a potential deal. It had initially moved up speculation of consolidation in the rail sector. Interested in seeing if we can break lows and sell off further today- overall doesn't seem like this is likely though, considering this news hit mid-day and we've had rest of the day for information digestion. Buffett obviously has a heavy hand in the stocks he's involved in (like UNH).

Now, here’s the real kicker..

Of course, there are still headwinds. They’re burning cash every quarter, and dilution risk is hanging over the stock. Market knows it, that’s why we’re not mooning yet. But this flight keep the story alive and buy them time with investors. The fact that analysts and retail fair value estimates range from $3 to $30 just shows how split the market is.

**So here’s where I’m at:**

- TA says we’re sitting on a knife edge at $9.

- Fundamentals say Archer’s tech keeps leveling up, United’s watching closely & the path to early ops is real.

- Risks are dilution + losses, but the catalyst flow is stacking

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Trump and RFK Jr. to Ban COVID-19 Vaccine ‘Within Months’,1n02bqo,WickedSensitiveCrew,2025-08-25 20:52:37,1048,0.95,204,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n02bqo/trump_and_rfk_jr_to_ban_covid19_vaccine_within/,"https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-and-robert-f-kennedy-junior-to-ban-covid-19-vaccine-within-months/

> The Trump administration will move to pull the COVID vaccine off the U.S. market “within months,” one of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s closest associates has told the Daily Beast. Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British cardiologist who has repeatedly claimed in the face of scientific consensus that the vaccines are more dangerous than the virus, told the Daily Beast that Kennedy’s stance is shared by “influential” members of President Donald Trump’s family. Like Kennedy himself, no Trumps hold any scientific qualifications. Malhotra is a leading adviser to the controversial lobby group Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Action, which is seen as an external arm of Kennedy’s agenda as Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary. He told the Beast that many of those closest to RFK Jr. have told him they “cannot understand” why the vaccine continues to be prescribed, and that a decision to remove the vaccine from the U.S. market pending further research will come “within months,” even if it is likely to cause “fear of chaos” and bring with it major legal ramifications.

> “It could [happen] in a number of stages, including learning more about the data,” said Malhotra, who said there was an ongoing review into so-called “vaccine injuries” by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). “But given the increased talk of vaccine injuries in the past few weeks among the administration, it could also come with one clean decision.” Malhotra said skepticism among Kennedy’s circle of the COVID-19 jab is driven by a 2022 paper by a group of physicians and university professors and researchers, which appeared in the journal Vaccine. The peer-reviewed paper examined secondary analysis of “serious adverse events reported in… clinical trials of Pfizer and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in adults,” and said that those given the mRNA vaccines had a 16 percent higher risk of “excess serious adverse events” than those in the placebo group.

> However, the study has been dismissed by large parts of the medical community, who say it underestimates the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines and overstates risks due to methodological flaws, biased data selection, and ignoring broader public health impacts.

A thorough analysis of PSKY (5-year DCF included),1mzwiae,ticketbroken,2025-08-25 17:14:18,5,0.58,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mzwiae/a_thorough_analysis_of_psky_5year_dcf_included/,"Background - Skydance Media was a private company founded by David Ellison (son of Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle with an estimated ~$300b net worth) in 2006. Skydance co-financed and co-produced major blockbuster films with established studios, such as Paramount.  Some of the films they worked on include World War Z, Annihilation, 4 Mission Impossible films, and Top Gun: Maverick. 

While private, Skydance received a $275m investment from RedBird Capital Partners and CJ ENM in 2020, and a $400m investment round led by KKR in 2022. The 2022 round reportedly valued Skydance at $4b.

Merger and Agreement Terms - Paramount was struggling in 2023 and explored sale options. Sony & Apollo Global Management offered a non-binding bid of $26b in May of 2024. Paramount continued talks with competitors for the bid and achieved a preliminary agreement to merge with Skydance in June of 2024. Skydance would pay ~$2.4billion in cash for National Amusements (the privately held holding company that controlled Paramount Global), inject $1.5billion in capital, and engage in an all-stock merger valued at ~$4.75billion. Paramount shareholders would receive $4.5billion in cash and equity. The SEC approved of the merger deal in early 2025 and the FCC approved in July of 2025. The merger officially closed on August 7th, 2025, resulting in the formation of Paramount Skydance. Before the merger, National Amusements had approximately 79% voting power, but now, after the merger took place, David Ellison has 50% voting control, Larry Ellison has 27.5%, and Redbird Capital Partners has 22.5%. Skydance currently holds approximately 70% of equity post-merger, leaving a significantly smaller 30% of the float (approximately $3-$4billion) for the public. This small float has been a highlight for the concern surrounding people investing in PSKY.

Two notable deals took place almost immediately after the merger. 1. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone struck a 5-year $1.5billion deal with Paramount Skydance, giving Paramount Skydance streaming rights to all 26 seasons and 50 new episodes. 2. Just days after the merger closed, Paramount Skydance closed a $7.7billion deal with TKO Group (UFC parent company) for 7 years of exclusive UFC media rights, which will consist of approximately 13 major UFC numbered events and 30 fight night cards per year. All UFC events will be streaming on paramount+ at no additional cost, effectively eliminating UFC pay-per-view.

Paramount Skydance Structure - The company is divided into 3 main units - Studios, Direct-to-Consumer, and TV Media. Studios is the company’s content creation engine that produces films, shows, and animation. Studios includes recognizable names such as Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Movies, and CBS studios. The Direct-to-Consumer division is the streaming unit. Direct-to-Consumer is the fastest growing and most competitive of the 3 and consists of Paramount+, Plutotv, and Showtime. Paramount+ has been rolling out internationally and is now available in 18 countries (US, Canada, Mexico, UK, Ireland, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay). The streaming unit has live sport deals with the NFL, NCAA, Champions League, and now the UFC. The third unit is the traditional television and cable network arm, which generates (declining) revenue from advertising. Its networks include MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Nickelodeon, CBS, BET, and the Smithsonian Channel among others.

DCF - I conducted a Discounted Cash Flow valuation writeup with the results displayed below. 

Growth rate 3/5/9%, WACC 6.43%, terminal growth 3%

Case 1: 5% operating margin
Bear: EV ~$32B → Equity ~$19.6B → $18.5/share 
Base: EV ~$35B → Equity ~$22.7B → $21.4/share 
Bull: EV ~$42B → Equity ~$29.5B → $27.9/share

Case 2: 10% operating margin (Netflix-competitive expansion. I think this is doable given their resources)
Bear: EV ~$64.8B → Equity ~$52B → $49/share 
Base: EV ~$70.9B → Equity ~$58.1B → $55/share 
Bull: EV ~$84.6B → Equity ~$71.8B → $68/share

This stock is currently priced as if the company will never make much money. But even if it does just ok, the shares appear undervalued. If it executes in a somewhat similar fashion to Netflix, it could quickly turn into a 3-4x return. At today’s $16/share, even the 5% margin case shows some undervaluation (15-75% upside). If they can maintain their ~10% margins long-term, the upside is significantly larger. I view this stock as a levered bet on whether management can turn streaming/content spend into sustainable profitability.

Future Plans - Paramount Skydance’s near-term plans include merging Paramount+ with Pluto TV and leveraging Oracle’s technology by working out a $100m/year cloud services deal. David has repeatedly expressed that he knows the importance of technology in the entertainment industry and will not be shying away from utilizing it as opposed to carrying on with traditional methods. He wants Paramount Skydance to be a “technology-first media enterprise.” David’s ambition and experience have led to a steady stream of deals being conducted, including a four-year overall deal signed with the Duffer brothers (creators of Stranger Things) just last week.

Cramer stating this is a Meme stock artificially deterred retail from getting involved, which allows firms to have more control over the share price, allows for profitable practices such as pinning the stock (which hurts options retail investors, notice how the last options date reached expiration with a share price of exactly $16), and get into their positions without any unexpected spikes/dips. The “Meme stock” label is completely unfounded in my opinion, even with the relatively small float.

Quick financial factors not mentioned above - $17b market cap, $29b revenue, $1.5b operating profits, $15.5b total debt (as of June), $346m short-term debt (as of June)

NVDA Up 35% Into Earnings,1mzwfjs,Basat098,2025-08-25 17:11:36,366,0.91,160,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mzwfjs/nvda_up_35_into_earnings/,"Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday (Aug 27) after the close, and the setup looks like a textbook high-stakes event. The stock is currently trading at $181.30, up over 35% in the past three months, and the technicals tell a mixed story heading into earnings. On the positive side, the long-term trend is still strong. Nvidia is trading above its 10-day ($179), 50-day ($167), and 200-day ($137) moving averages, which confirms that the uptrend remains intact and the bulls are in control on a broader timeframe.

However, the short-term signals show some cracks. The RSI sits at 73.4, which is firmly in overbought territory. To be clear, this doesn’t always mean the stock will drop immediately, but it does raise the probability of profit-taking in the near term. The MACD has slipped below the signal line (2.92 vs. 4.43), and the histogram has been shrinking since mid-August, indicating fading momentum. Volume has also flatlined while price continued to rise, often a sign that buyers are running out of steam ahead of a major catalyst.

Historically, Nvidia tends to move around ±8% after its earnings announcements. Given the massive run it’s already had this quarter, the risk/reward skews toward the downside. Yes, if Nvidia beats expectations and raises guidance, the stock could break through $190–200 and extend its rally. But with RSI overbought, MACD momentum weakening, and volume drying up, there’s also a real chance of a “sell the news” reaction back toward $170 to 160, even on solid earnings.

TLDR: The long-term trend remains bullish, but in the short-term, Nvidia is priced for perfection. Technicals suggest momentum is tiring, so investors should be prepared for volatility and not be surprised if the first reaction is red before the next leg higher.",2025-08-25,0.9413,Positive,"['RSI', 'MACD', 'RSI', 'MACD', 'TLDR']"

"Nvidia’s new ‘robot brain’ goes on sale for $3,499 as company targets robotics for growth",1mztcbq,Puginator,2025-08-25 15:18:51,270,0.93,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mztcbq/nvidias_new_robot_brain_goes_on_sale_for_3499_as/,"Nvidia announced Monday that its latest robotics chip module, the Jetson AGX Thor, is now on sale for $3,499 as a developer kit.

The company calls the chip a “robot brain.” The first kits ship next month, Nvidia said last week, and the chips will allow customers to create robots.

After a company uses the developer kit to prototype their robot, Nvidia will sell Thor T5000 modules that can be installed in production-ready robots. If a company needs more than 1,000 Thor chips, Nvidia will charge $2,999 per module.

CEO Jensen Huang has said robotics is the company’s largest growth opportunity outside of artificial intelligence, which has led to the Nvidia’s overall sales more than tripling in the past two years.

“We do not build robots, we do not build cars, but we enable the whole industry with our infrastructure computers and the associated software,” said Deepu Talla, Nvidia’s vice president of robotics and edge AI, on a call with reporters Friday.

The Jetson Thor chips are based on a Blackwell graphics processor, which is Nvidia’s current generation of technology used in its AI chips, as well as its chips for computer games.

Nvidia said that its Jetson Thor chips are 7.5 times faster than its previous generation. That allows them to run generative AI models, including large language models and visual models that can interpret the world around them, which is essential for humanoid robots, Nvidia said. The Jetson Thor chips are equipped with 128GB of memory, which is essential for big AI models.

Companies including Agility Robotics, Amazon, Meta and Boston Dynamics are using its Jetson chips, Nvidia said. Nvidia has also invested in robotics companies such as Field AI.

However, robotics remains a small business for Nvidia, accounting for about 1% of the company’s total revenue, despite the fact that it has launched several new robot chips since 2014. But it’s growing fast.

Nvidia recently combined its business units to group its automotive and robotics divisions into the same line item. That unit reported $567 million in quarterly sales in May, which represented a 72% increase on an annual basis.

The company said its Jetson Thor chips can be used for self-driving cars as well, especially from Chinese brands. Nvidia calls its car chips Drive AGX, and while they are similar to its robotics chips, they run an operating system called Drive OS that’s been tuned for automotive purposes.

My OKTA Earnings analysis,1mzr7y5,danieljapps,2025-08-25 13:57:53,54,0.85,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mzr7y5/my_okta_earnings_analysis/,"Here is my analysis of Okta Inc.'s earnings – ticker: OKTA – after the market close tomorrow.

General information about the company:

Okta Inc. is a leading provider of cloud-based identity and access management solutions for businesses. Its business model is based on providing a platform that allows employees and customers to log in securely and seamlessly to a wide variety of applications (“Identity as a Service”). Core products include single sign-on (SSO) for centralized access, adaptive multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security, lifecycle management for user accounts, and API access controls.

Market situation/competition:

OKTA may not be able to do much, but what they can do, no one else can match. Various market research companies expect annual growth of 10-15% in the identity and access management segment until 2030, and OKTA is currently the market leader in this area. Another company in this segment is CyberArk Software (with only half as many customers as OKTA), which was recently acquired by Palo Alto Networks (PANW) for USD 25 billion.

If CyberArk, with half as many customers as OKTA, is worth USD 25 billion in a takeover, how can OKTA, as the market leader, have a market capitalization of only USD 16 billion? So there is basically room for growth.

Why the earnings play?

OKTA delivered strong figures in its last quarterly report and exceeded expectations. However, it did not raise its annual forecast, citing the current uncertainty in the market and the inability to assess whether this uncertainty could have a negative impact on its business figures. As a result, the share price fell by 15%, and has since fallen by as much as 25%.

Later, in the Q&A section of the earnings call and in interviews with the CEO, it became clear that OKTA did not raise its forecast simply because it was only the first quarter of the fiscal year, but that the company is very bullish overall.

I assume that if the second quarter is also positive, the annual forecast will be raised this time.

But how can I know if the second quarter was positive?

Thankfully, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) – in the same industry and the company that recently bought OKTA's competitor for USD 25 billion – published its quarterly figures on August 18. And lo and behold, the quarterly figures exceeded expectations.

In addition, OKTA is known for exceeding expectations, having done so in each of the last seven earnings reports. I see no reason why this quarter should be any different. So OKTA's Q2 expectations are easy to beat again this time around.

EPS of $0.85 is expected, which OKTA already exceeded in Q1. Revenue of $712 million is expected, an increase of 10% compared to Q2 of the previous year. Did I mention the market research that predicts annual growth of 10-15% in the industry until 2030? OKTA's expectations for Q2, with a 10% increase compared to the previous year, are therefore at the lower end of the range and should be easy to exceed.

As a reminder, we didn't have a problem with expectations not being exceeded in the last earnings report. The problem was that the annual forecast was not raised.

After a successful Q2, I see no reason why the guidance should not be raised this time. The stock should then skyrocket and fly towards the moon. I think 15-25% is possible after the sell-off following the Q1 earnings.

My assessment of the earnings:

>85% probability that the quarterly figures will be positive.
>75% probability that the annual forecast will be raised this time.",2025-08-25,0.9904,Positive,"['OKTA', 'SSO', 'MFA', 'API', 'OKTA', 'OKTA', 'OKTA', 'PANW', 'USD', 'OKTA', 'USD', 'OKTA', 'USD', 'OKTA', 'CEO', 'OKTA', 'PANW', 'OKTA', 'USD', 'OKTA', 'OKTA', 'EPS', 'OKTA', 'OKTA']"

"Joby Aviation promised 2,000 jobs in Ohio… but progress looks slow, will it affect stock?",1mznovk,Zealousideal-Sky-973,2025-08-25 11:17:14,61,0.84,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mznovk/joby_aviation_promised_2000_jobs_in_ohio_but/,"Last year, Joby Aviation made headlines for announcing a huge project in Dayton, Ohio  2,000 jobs and nearly $500M in investment. In exchange, Ohio pledged up to $200M in incentives.

**Fast forward to now:** the facility they leased is still quiet, their website only shows a handful of open roles in Dayton, and their CEO sidestepped questions about progress on the last earnings call. Some local reports are starting to raise flags that this might not be going as promised.

**From an investor standpoint, I’m wondering:**

- Is this just normal lag time with these kinds of big facilities?

- Or should we take it as a sign that Joby tends to over promise?


The eVTOL space is already high risk and speculative. So if anyone here thinks this Ohio deal falling short could hurt long term credibility for $JOBY, or if the market just shrugs it off as *business as usual*

And in this situation he even talks about downside risks to jobs, my god

Talking about rate cuts when inflation could blow up anytime is insane, if he loosens money the inflation that was already about to hit will get stronger, businesses and consumers will start anchoring their expectations,Today’s 25 points could end up needing 50 to 75 points of rate hikes later to pay back



The Fed shouldn’t be taking on employment, even if they cut 50 or 100 today, companies might just use it for automation, AI, buybacks, cash… maybe it doesn’t even have 10% of the effect

Why DCA into a rising stock and give yourself a worse cost average?,1mz9ul4,Readonly00,2025-08-24 22:41:59,0,0.23,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mz9ul4/why_dca_into_a_rising_stock_and_give_yourself_a/,"Probably a dumb question but if my original cost basis for a stock is 5 dollars, and it rises nicely and I buy the same number of shares again at 10 dollars, my average will now be 7.50. 

If the price goes up again to 15 and I increase my shareholdings again so (eg) my new cost basis is 12.50, but then the stock goes down 10% to 13.50, my cost basis is only 1 dollar better than the share value. 

Why do that, when you could stick with your original 5 dollar cost basis, and be up 8.50 per share? Your gain if you sell at that point is really dented by having averaged upwards. Especially because you've put so much extra money into DCAing, and now you're sitting on the inherent risk of a larger holding at stake.

It seems like if you want to maximise your gains you should DCA into a stock as soon as possible during its early rise, eg at 5.50, 6, 7 etc, and then just stop buying before your cost basis gets dragged up too high, if the stock keeps rising. 

Then just enjoy your bigger leeway when the stock has a red day, that you're still in the green because of your low cost basis.

Jackson Hole 1982: The Fed Meeting That Sparked a Historic Bull Market | Investing.com UK,1myreud,coinfanking,2025-08-24 09:47:13,44,0.76,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1myreud/jackson_hole_1982_the_fed_meeting_that_sparked_a/," the story of two dramatic Friday the 13th (of August) markets, the first being the time President Nixon gathered his Brain Trust in Camp David to devalue the dollar and close the gold window.

The second dramatic Friday, August 13th, came in 1982 – after America suffered 140% inflation in the 11 years after that gold-to-dollar devaluation. On Friday, August 13, 1982, a morbid market suddenly turned back up, in the strongest bull surge of the modern era, after a jackpot Dow Jones Industrial Average closing of 777 the day before.

August 1982 also marked the first meeting of top Fed economists at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a tradition which continues this week (August 21-23), in another retreat for leading global central bankers in the furthest Western outpost of the Kansas City Fed’s district. The first (1978) KC Fed symposium met in Kansas City, followed by jaunts to Vail and Denver, Colorado, but in 1982, the event moved to Jackson Hole, mostly since then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker liked to indulge in some relaxing fly fishing in the area.


As it turns out, Missouri is the headquarters for two of the Fed’s 12 districts. The second is the great champion of monetary economics, the St. Louis Fed, which specializes in statistical studies and historical charts, using its FRED database. (The Kansas City district is more of a Midwest farm-oriented district.)

From the three years between his induction as Fed Chairman in August 1979 and the 1982 Jackson Hole meeting, the tall, commanding Fed Chair Paul Volcker conquered double-digit hyper-inflation by raising the Fed funds rates above 20%. By August of 1982, we faced deflation and a deep recession, so the KC Fed decided to lure Volcker to Jackson Hole by appealing to his love of fly fishing and stunning vistas.


Since 1982, there have been plenty of dramatic announcements in Jackson Hole, most notably the debut of Chairman Ben Bernanke’s seemingly endless declarations of more “quantitative easing” (QE), in each year of the 2010 to 2013 Jackson Hole meetings. Specifically, Bernanke announced QE1, QE2, QE3, and “tapering,” which caused a Taper Tantrum in 2013. Then came the introduction of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) by ECB President Mario Draghi at the 2014 meeting. In that long span of monetary easing, the Fed also had a Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) with 0.25% rates from 2009 to 2015. It was like the Fed wanted President Obama to enjoy easy money “training wheels” during his full eight years.


The Fed Is So Powerful That It Can Kill Markets – And Then Resurrect Them.


Fed policy obviously impacts the markets – from the inflationary 1970s under Fed Chair Arthur Burns, then Volcker’s deflationary medicine and Bernanke’s QE mania, but Volcker made both positive and negative history in his eight-year run. First, he killed the market and economy, causing two deep back-to-back recessions, 1979-82. Then he resurrected the markets and the economy – quite a miracle-worker!

But it makes me wonder how it'd work on a time horizon of five to ten years. In case you have thoughts about it, or backtested it, I'd love to hear about it.

1. Instead of buying SPX so that you keep track of the market, simply buy ATM call options for one year (LEAPS) for the same number of quantities. You'd be investing lot less. Each year, rinse and repeat as you will have cash on hand. The only way you'd go bankrupt is if the market fails to give any gain for a number of consecutive years. 

For example if you have 100K, and assuming it takes 20K to buy the number of lots equivalent to 100K worth of SPX one year call, you keep ploughing in 20K each year. The only way you'll go bankrupt is if SPX goes down for five straight years. This might have happened in the past, but during the last decade, I think this might have worked well.

2. The second strategy is the standard one. The fifty-fifty rebalancing idea. Hold 50% SPX, and 50% bonds. After one year, if SPX has more value, rebalance so that it is still 50-50. I have a hunch that this may not do better than investing all of the cash into SPX and just sit on it for a decade or so, but during times when market falls by 50% like during GFC, you'd have a ton of cash to invest so that that returns would be pretty good for a few consecutive years (assuming of course that SPX would recover the way it did back then).",2025-08-23,0.971,Positive,"['SPX', 'ATM', 'LEAPS', 'SPX', 'SPX', 'SPX', 'SPX', 'SPX', 'GFC', 'SPX']"

Duolingo Stock Overvalued,1mxnaa7,OJpopsicle,2025-08-23 00:31:01,151,0.85,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mxnaa7/duolingo_stock_overvalued/,"DUOL has been in a downtrend ever since it peaked at $544 in May. It beat earnings earlier this month which led to a spike, peaking at $446 but has since continued down to $334. 

From what I've personally seen, duolingo has gained a lot of popularity earlier this year with their social media manager Zaria Parvez excellently marketing the brand. I've seen dozens of videos of a person dressed as the duolingo mascot doing things like having celebrity collaborations which drew a lot of attention towards the brand. As a result, their subscriptions have increased to 10.9 million. However, Zaria has just left the company, and with her being the reason the stock has increased as much as it has, I think the hype about this stock will die down.

More recently they've started adding new features in the app, like learning chess. But I'm certain this won't catch on. I used duolingo a year ago and it gets old very shortly, and even if I were to use the app, I wouldn't subscribe just to not see ads. It's a bad product that had good marketing.

With a PE of around 130, and a market cap of 15 billion, I don't see how this company can justify its high valuation, especially as it continues to lose public interest.

The World's 10 Wealthiest People Became $33 Billion Richer After Powell's Jackson Hole Speech,1mxffmv,coinfanking,2025-08-22 19:08:18,622,0.9,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mxffmv/the_worlds_10_wealthiest_people_became_33_billion/,"



A broader market rally, sparked by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s signaling possible interest rate cuts on Friday, added billions of dollars to the net worths of the world’s wealthiest.


What Did Powell Say In Jackson Hole?
Powell’s comments, which came Friday at the central bank’s symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, were widely read to suggest interest rate cuts were on their way. Powell said a stable unemployment rate and other economic readings allows the central bank to “proceed carefully” with changes to monetary policy, as the “shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.” The labor market had improved and the U.S. economy showed ""resilience,"" Powell said, though he noted tariffs could “spur a more lasting inflation dynamic” that might be “a risk to be assessed and managed.” The expected cuts follow months of President Donald Trump haranguing Powell, demanding a larger rate cut.


How Did Stocks React To Powell’s Speech?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 900 points to a fresh intraday record while the S&P 500 increased nearly 1.5% and Nasdaq jumped about 1.7%. A similar rally occurred after Powell signaled the “time has come” for the Fed to lower interest rates in his Jackson Hole speech last year. Powell’s comments forecasting a looser monetary policy struck a different chord than in 2022, during which Powell’s then-hawkish speech pushed the S&P down by more than 3% and nearly 7% in the week after. people.https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/08/22/the-worlds-10-wealthiest-people-became-33-billion-richer-after-powells-jackson-hole-speech/

As tariffs, inflation, costs of living continue to rise, more and more Americans will be pushed toward Walmart. Walmart has kept it's promise, unlike other stores to have really low prices.

https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/business/powell-speech-jackson-hole-fed-inflation.html


Just watched Powell at Jackson Hole. So basically, cuts are finally on the table. He didn’t say that he is gonna cut rates now but he basically opened the door and left it ajar. He called out a weird labor market where both hiring and the supply of workers are cooling at the same time and his words made it sound like the risk of layoffs can sneak up fast if they don’t ease up a bit. He also admitted policy isn’t as restrictive as it was earlier, so there’s room to step down without going soft. 

He’s still worried about inflation getting sticky from tariffs and doesn’t want expectations to un-anchor. So it’s still somewhat data-dependent but he pointed to a possible move as soon as the next meeting if the jobs data keeps softening. So TLDR, cut is more likely than it was yesterday, just not a slam dunk. Good news I reckon overall.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Second-quarter adjusted earnings landed at 68 cents per share, six cents shy of Wall Street estimates, weighed down by higher insurance claims, legal costs, and restructuring charges. The stock slipped as much as 4.4% in early New York tradingits sharpest drop since Maybefore stabilizing. Analysts described the earnings shortfall as more of a temporary setback than a shift in the long-term story, suggesting these cost pressures could moderate in the months ahead.

> Jeff Wang got a big promotion last month. There were lots of tears, but not the happy kind. The 39-year-old was unexpectedly named interim CEO of artificial intelligence coding startup Windsurf. The company had been in discussions with OpenAI about a potential acquisition that would have resulted in a handsome payday for many employees. But the talks fell apart and, on July 11, several founders and top researchers instead left to join Google as part of a $2.4 billion licensing deal.   As one of the highest-ranking executives remaining at Windsurf, Wang was elevated to the top job, at least for the time being. His first order of business, he told CNBC, was to break the news at a tense all-hands meeting at the startup’s Silicon Valley headquarters. “It was a very, very challenging day,” Wang said. “People were crying. It was very, very emotional. I was spending half the time calming down people, because they have families and they got nothing.”

> Windsurf is part of a growing crop of AI startups whose founders and top researchers have been poached by megacaps like Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon through high-priced talent grabs that are helping the biggest companies skirt regulatory scrutiny. While the deals often produce big payouts for founders and AI leaders, they can leave investors, other employees and the remaining company in limbo. Samir Kumar, a general partner at Touring Capital, said that what’s left is something resembling a zombie company. “There’s a big question of what their future prospects are,” Kumar said. “Frankly, you hollowed out the organization.”  The headline-grabbing deal came in June, when Meta rocked the tech industry by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in data labeling startup Scale AI. As part of the agreement, Meta took a 49% stake in the company, hired its CEO Alexandr Wang to lead a new superintelligence lab and said it would deepen the work it does with Scale. A month later, Scale cut 200 full-time employees, or 14% of its staff. Meta’s investment had doubled Scale’s valuation from $14 billion last year. But that number only exists on paper.

> Microsoft used a similar playbook in March 2024, when it hired Inflection AI’s co-founders and other staffers. Amazon has completed two such deals in the last year, nabbing the founders and top talent away from Adept in June 2024, and from Covariant two months later. Google inked a $2.7 billion licensing deal with Character.AI and hired its founders last August.

> For Silicon Valley venture investors, long the lifeblood of risky tech startups, the system isn’t functioning as intended. Companies that would otherwise be on the path to a potential initial public offering or lucrative acquisition are getting pulled apart, with the bulk of the cash ending up in the pockets of the founders and their leading engineers. “The money doesn’t flow as straightforwardly as it would in just a pure M&A transaction,” said Rob Toews, partner at Radical Ventures.",2025-08-21,0.9795,Positive,"['CEO', 'CNBC', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'CEO', 'AI', 'AI']"

Ballooning costs for marginal gains is not unique to OpenAI - [Gemini is projected to have cost Google nearly 200M$ to train, other models with similar costs.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/training-costs-of-ai-models-over-time/) It is already predicted that [AI will run out of training data sometime in 2026](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/artificial-intelligence-future), at which point it will likely need to start generating data to train itself on. This could lead to more hallucination and less nuanced data, potentially even leading to misalignment as described by the paper [AI 2027.](https://ai-2027.com/) A paper which most engineers now consent is more likely to happen in the 2040s rather than in 2027 like previously predicted.

Where is the limit to this? When and by how much will AI really be profitable? Is AGI even possible with our current technology? When does the bubble burst?

This in and of itself may sound as bullish news for the oil, gas, and coal industries as money rotates into these sectors from renewables, but my bull case for stocks in the power industry has more to do with the direction of AI advancement and the role of power production in that.

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/08/20/trump-says-us-will-not-approve-solar-or-wind-power-projects.html

AI technology is really comprised of three segments: chips, data centers, and power. As of today, the chip companies have surged in share price (though they’re starting to take a hit), data centers are being developed expeditiously and backed by heavy investment, and, on the power side, we’re checks notes blocking the growth of a major sector of the power generation industry? There’s a weak link in this group. The forward-looking market potentially pricing in this worsening barrier to AI growth could be the first step towards an “AI Bubble” popping. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and Google make up over 25% of the S&P 500, and they’re at risk of taking a hit if something isn’t quickly done by the Federal Government to address a known upcoming bottleneck for AI advancement: Energy production. Sam Altman of OpenAI reportedly wants to spend “trillions” on data center development, and these data centers all need to be powered somehow (I’ll touch on this a little later). To sustain the US’ technological advancement, our energy production must expand to meet the needs of the data centers, and the Trump administration just slashed the fastest growing sector of the power industry. If we stop expanding renewable energy, non-renewable energy must grow, and I think the federal government will be motivated by the race with China and the pressure of a stock market downturn to give some support to the big oil, gas, and coal players.

Info on the AI-energy bottleneck: https://qz.com/ai-data-center-boom-us-power-grid-struggles

US is behind China on energy production for data centers: https://fortune.com/2025/08/14/data-centers-china-grid-us-infrastructure/

Chevron and Occidental are two US based oil and gas companies I’ve got my eye on. They’re both backed by Berkshire Hathaway (notably, more $CVX was acquired in Q2 by Berkshire), they’re positioned to later transition into renewables if the political landscape proves it to be more advantageous in the future, and, most importantly, they are poised to moon.

$MP was the big position I took in April, and this current situation gives me very similar vibes. Here’s the analogy: China is far ahead of the US in certain crucial resources (rare earth metals and energy production) necessary for technological advancement, then political policy placed constraints on the supply. The US’ access to energy is not being immediately slashed like it was with the China rare earth metals ban, however, we are approaching an AI-energy bottleneck and high interest rates + cuts to funding for renewable energy + Trump’s new stance on just not approving renewable energy projects is choking a significant and expanding sector of an industry that the country NEEDS to expand. We also know Trump does not want to be reliant on other countries for resources crucial to the US’ technological advancement.

At minimum, I see more news coverage (as a result of Trump’s latest statements) on the energy industry’s role as one of the Big 3 in the AI space, therefore pushing the stock price up. My more optimistic prediction is that new policies will be announced in which the federal government gives greater support to the oil, gas, and coal industries in a similar way to what happened with $MP.

Now, here’s the sleeper play. In doing my research on data center development, which as a reminder, Sam Altman intends to invest “trillions” into, I came across something of interest. Oracle has partnered with OpenAI and is in rapid development of data centers for OpenAI. The demand for these data centers is so large that developers like Oracle are planning to build them and get them off the ground far before they’re able to connect these data centers to the power grid. How will the data centers be powered without connection to the power grid? Gas generators made by Bloom Energy ($BE). It’s a bit more of a speculative play, but this company is focused on gas generators for data centers, they’ve got contracts, and the demand is very quickly surging.

Walmart hikes sales and earnings outlook even as it says tariff costs are rising,1mw9m7o,Puginator,2025-08-21 12:31:29,155,0.93,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mw9m7o/walmart_hikes_sales_and_earnings_outlook_even_as/,"Walmart on Thursday raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook as its online business posted another quarter of double-digit gains, even as the company said costs are rising from higher tariffs. 

The big-box retailer topped Wall Street’s quarterly sales estimates but fell short of earnings expectations, the first time it missed on quarterly earnings since May 2022. The company said it felt pressure on profits for the period, including from some one-time expenses, such as restructuring costs, pricier insurance claims and litigation settlements.

Walmart said it now expects net sales to grow between 3.75% to 4.75% for the fiscal year, up from its previous expectations for 3% to 4%. It raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook slightly to $2.52 to $2.62, up from a prior range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.

In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company is working hard to keep prices low – including speeding up imports from overseas and stepping up the number of Rollbacks, or limited-time discounts, in its stores. 

“This is managed on an item-by-item and category-by-category basis,” he said. “There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs. There are other areas where we’ve had to pass some of those costs along.”

But he added “tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards.” 

Even so, Rainey said Walmart hasn’t seen a change in customer spending. For example, sales of private label items, which typically cost less than national brands, were roughly flat year over year, he said.

“Everyone is looking to see if there are any creaks in the armor or anything that’s happening with the consumer, but it’s been very consistent,” he said. “They continue to be very resilient.”

Yet on the company’s earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said middle- and lower-income households have been more sensitive to tariff-related price increases, particularly in discretionary categories.

“We see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items, or in some cases, categories,” he said.

Here’s what the big-box reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 68 cents adjusted vs. 74 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $177.40 billion vs. $176.16 billion

Walmart shares fell nearly 4% in premarket trading Thursday.

Walmart’s net income jumped to $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. 

Revenue rose from $169.34 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. climbed 4.6% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, as both the grocery and health and wellness category saw strong growth. That was higher than the 4% increase that analysts expected. The industry metric**,** also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.

At Sam’s Club, comparable sales jumped 5.9% excluding fuel, higher than the 5.2% that analysts anticipated.

Valuations: Valuations at historical highs are inflated by return expectations on major SPY components, based on their supposed resilience due to dominant market positions and anticipated AI-driven efficiency gains. In reality, this is largely speculative. We are at the onset of a shifting economy, and today’s bets resemble venture capital at the start of the dot-com bubble; all the eggs are in the same basket…the bubble, for a future demand that is difficult to explain and quantify in a new ecosystem that is being invented!

US debt: U.S. federal debt will continue to grow. Meanwhile, Japan faces a demographic crisis. While they haven’t taken drastic steps yet, indicators suggest Japan is actively seeking alternatives to rebuild its economy, which would likely involve a significant decoupling from U.S. debt. Will happen before december

Geopolitics: Russia is not withdrawing from Ukraine, and the West is deluding itself by expecting otherwise. Israel is preparing for a large-scale offensive in Gaza that will destabilize the region further ( imminent) . Any incident that can be framed as a justification for striking Iran will likely be used ( by November) The Trump administration is preparing measures for Venezuela ( By October) This sequence of events could push more Western countries to react: Canada may enter “full military cooperation with Europe,” while Mexico, Brazil, and other Latin American nations (excluding the “special case” Argentina) will probably announce expanded defense partnerships and arms purchases with Europe. ( By december)

Interest rate priced in: Rate cuts of up to 50 basis points are expected by year-end, but these are likely already priced in. As a result, any cut could trigger additional sell-offs.

Seasonal trading: As year-end approaches, expect seasonal dynamics: portfolio rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, and positioning for 2026.

The Ballet Dancers: Tesla’s stock has been volatile, but Q3 earnings will provide clarity. A sell-off is likely, influenced by broader market beta. Palantir, meanwhile, looks poised to fall back below $75. ( by october)

But I have this conviction that LLMs have been massively oversold. In my opinion, and the opinion of many experts in the field, they have fundamental and serious limitations. AI companies have been allocated way too much capital, and there's no way this matches the value of their current flagship architecture, nor can the models even ever improve significantly enough. It's a dead end in my opinion. 

But if you spot such an egregious overvaluation within the stock market, how do you even try to bet the bubble bursts in a sensible manner?

This post is for long-term investors that want to profit from the AI era:*



We are in another DeepSeek like Tech stock selloff (remember Feb'25) because of misinterpretation of Sam Altman's AI bubble comments:

**SOURCE (from Sam Altman's interview with The Verge):**

[https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview](https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview)

>ChatGPT has roughly quadrupled its user base in a year and is now reaching over 700 million people each week. “Pretty soon, billions of people a day will be talking to ChatGPT,” Altman said. “We’re the fifth biggest website in the world right now. I think we’re on the clear path to the third.”

>For its operation to keep scaling, OpenAI needs a lot more GPUs. This is one of Altman’s top priorities. **“You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,”** he confidently told the room.

>“We have to make these horrible trade-offs right now,” he said. “**We have better models, and we just can’t offer them because we don’t have the capacity.** We have other kinds of new products and services we’d love to offer.”

>He also thinks we’re in an AI bubble. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he explained. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. **Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.”**

**MY TAKE:**

* People saw the mention of Tech Bubble and started selling off Tech stocks!!
* In reality, he is just saying that there are a bunch of AI Tech startups (**software**) that are getting a tons of venture funding and many will fail
* But OpenAI and other leading LLM providers will still need trillions of dollars of GPU's
* OpenAI (and others) already have better models and products/services today but can't offer them to people because they don't have the GPU/Data Center capacity *(AI context size limitation/memory is a major constraint)*

When you understand this, you will invest appropriately and make fortunes from the AI investments while weak hands sell off

PSKY is NOT a meme stock,1mvl94g,ticketbroken,2025-08-20 17:25:15,4,0.54,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mvl94g/psky_is_not_a_meme_stock/,"Foundation: PSKY was recently acquired by David Ellison's Skydance. David Ellison is the son of Larry Ellison, the owner of Oracle, whose net worth is estimated to be over $300b. Larry's son and daughter are passionately into film and have each had successful careers in the industry. In David's first week as the CEO of Paramount, he signed deals with South Park ($1.5b for 5 years) and the UFC ($7.7b for 7 years). PSKY has a debt of $15.5b. There is a supposed 30% public float with 50% of the shares being held by the Ellisons and 20% by Redbird.

Discrepancy: PSKY has a market cap of $9b. They just made 2 deals worth $9.2b total. Paramount makes around $29b in revenue and had an operating income of $1.6b in 2024 and is almost there in the first two quarters of 2025. It's backed and 25% owned by one of the wealthiest people ever (Larry) and he's not just going to let his son's company get taken out by debt. 

Cramer saying it's a meme stock almost seemed intentional to get retail's money away from PSKY for the time being, but this stock seems like the best kept secret in the finance world right now.

> President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on a top policymaker at the Federal Reserve to resign, after one of his allies alleged that she committed mortgage fraud. In a letter dated August 15, Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte urged the Justice Department to investigate a pair of mortgages taken out in recent years by Fed Governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday, Trump referenced those allegations on his social media platform, writing that “Cook must resign, now!!!” Pulte, a vocal Trump ally, has frequently criticized the Fed and its leader, Chair Jerome Powell, for not lowering rates. He also called for closer scrutiny of the central bank’s costly refurbishment of its Washington, DC, headquarters.

> The new focus on Cook is an expansion of the Trump administration’s intense pressure campaign against the Fed, specifically central bankers who aren’t perceived as allies of the president. Trump is still loudly demanding the Fed lower interest rates, continuing to bash Powell with the moniker “Too Late.” After raising rates in recent years to fight pandemic inflation that reached 40-year highs in 2022, the central bank started to cut its benchmark lending rate last fall. While inflation earlier this year hovered close to the bank’s target rate of 2%, central bankers have paused further rate cuts while they ascertain the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs.",2025-08-20,-0.8965,Negative,['DC']

Amazon just recently launch Amazon auto, and on a first glance they only sell Hyundai cars at the moment. that list is now growing to include Hertz.

Amazon doesn't offer an insurance option at the moment, and so insurance options seem to be diverted to the seller, which Hyundai exclusively works with ROOT insurance. Despite the partnership, ROOT still only trades at a minuscule 1.3B marketcap. This is likely because ROOT & Hyundai has yet to build up a point of sale embedded platform yet. But when that does happen, that would be a large source of revenue for ROOT with millions of cars leased and purchased from Hyundai, kia & Genesis.

FYI, not many people know this, but HTZ does sell a huge amount of used vehicles. they sold 7.7B worth of vehicles last year, so being able to utilize a market place efficiently should help with their margins upon resale.

I'm considering a small allocation to the ORR Militia Long/Short Equity ETF ($ORR) as a way to get some active long/short exposure without the day-to-day stress of running my own hedges. Most of my stock portfolio is buy-and-hold, so this would be a satellite position rather than a core holding.

My quick take:

• Performance looks decent on a risk-adjusted basis (from what I can see so far), especially in choppier markets.

• The expense ratio feels on the high side compared to typical ETFs and even some other long/short funds.

• Appeal for me is diversification and potential downside dampening versus pure long beta.

Discussions remain fluid and no final decisions have been made, they said.

Thoughts on Rivian heading in 2026,1muk1s4,YungPersian,2025-08-19 14:29:33,31,0.76,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1muk1s4/thoughts_on_rivian_heading_in_2026/,"Rivian has been inching towards profitability posing two quarters of gross profit and securing investments in VW to give them runway in terms of cash. 

They still have some headwinds but their strategy seems solid. Some people may have noticed that Rivian showrooms are being set up a few steps away from Tesla showrooms. Additionally, in their recent earnings call Rivian announced later this year they were supposed to have an AI and autonomy day where they put upcoming features into focus. 

Beyond that, their EDVs are now available to any other business that would want them, they also
have the R2 which is supposed to compete against the model Y still on track for release before Q2 next year. They’ve really shifted to cutting costs wherever possible to get things right. 

They’re also a pretty respected brand with a fairly loyal customer base. Their strategy seems clear in that they plan to steal win share from a still-distracted and less-liked Tesla.

Going to some of the cons:
For tariffs they face headwinds like most manufacturers but they’ve stated a lot of components for their vehicles are made in the states so while they’re not immune to tariff impacts it is less pronounced. 

They like most EV manufacturers stand lose from EV incentives being removed. 

One last thought:

Rates are still high; BUT if Trump does what a lot of people are thinking he’ll do next year when Powell’s term is up, there may be a period of time where fed rates go lower . Without inflation being fixed it’s doubtful bond markets will budge; meaning it’ll be like the 70s where eventually the fed will be forced to jack rates back up. But maybe the timing of all of this could benefit launch sales for the R2. We really don’t know what will happen for sure when Powell’s term is up and how quickly things will move so this is more of a wildcard piece and I’m not trying to play roulette. 

Cash wise I’m not as concerned as I was a year ago of them running out. Seems like enough investors have a vested interest in this company working out and believe they will eventually. 

Valuation wise it’s pretty close to its rock bottom price where people were thinking their next stop was bankruptcy, but it seems like they’re starting to get things together. What are your thoughts?

[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\-SoftBank is buying stock equal to roughly 2% of Intel’s outstanding shares in a $2 billion investment, driving the stock up!! News hit AH yesterday, ultimately interested to see if INTC makes another run at the open and if we can sustain- we've made a massive 6% move already. Despite the bearish news of  US government potentially using CHIPS Act grants to buy equity in the company, SoftBank news seems purely bullish until we get more details. This hasn't moved other semis much (NVDA/AMD unaffected). Thank you Nana!!!

[**OPEN (Open Door)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OPEN&p=d)\-Carrie Wheeler resigned as chair and CEO and the board launched a search for her replacement. This has caused the stock to explode from $2.50 -> $4. Again, this has meme stock written all over it. Not too interested in any long-term plays, but interested in seeing if we can break $5 again. Currently short-biased.  Personally, I don't think this can make any kind of sustainable move because it's way too liquid to make any of those epic squeezes we've seen from other companies in the past- illiquidity is what drives the massive moves when people get squeezed. 

[**VKTX (Viking Therapeutics)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VKTX&p=d)\-Its experimental obesity pill disappointed in a mid-stage study, marking another weaker-than-expected result for an oral alternative to popular weight-loss injections.

Had an epic spike to the upside then sold off close to 35%-mainly looking for a bounce in this stock if we reach $25 again.

[**APLD (**Applied Digital Corp**)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=APLD&p=d)\-Announced they were breaking ground on Polaris Forge 2 - a $3B, 280MW AI factory in North Dakota. Cited ""unprecedented demand for AI compute infrastructure"". Interestingly enough, Sam Altman said yesterday that investors were ""overexcited about AI"".

Anyway, this stock has near doubled in the past 3 months and I'm interested to see if we can hold above $16. Hyperscalers are only viable if there's unrelenting demand and it seems that there isn't any reduction of demand (for now).

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Advice on rolling up OPEN covered calls,1mualac,Shadowthron8,2025-08-19 06:19:37,6,0.69,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mualac/advice_on_rolling_up_open_covered_calls/,"
Want to make sure I’m understanding this correctly. 
I sold 10 covered calls at 3.5 for 500 bucks credit. 
My share cost average for the 1,000 shares is 3.28
I understand that they’re in the money and will be assigned if they expire in the money- where the shares will be called away for a 220 profit, 720 total,or I’ll keep them if it expires out of the money, 500 total gain. 

My question is does it make sense for me to roll these up to 4.5 on the same expiration date for another 500, eat a little out of the total credit gained by closing the 3.5 calls (1000-790=210). 
But raise my potential gain for exercising from 220 at that 3.28 to 3.5 difference to 1250 if exercised at 4.5 (plus 210 premium for 1460 total)
Or it expiring worthless, keeping the shares and 210 in premium. 

Am I understanding this correctly and seeing it as a legitimate potential shift in strategy given my opinion on the underlying price trajectory?

Orforglipron (Phase III, expected submission Q4 2025): this is their small molecule oral GLP-1 agonist. There was much disappointment about trial results and all that, but one thing that isn't in doubt is this, it'll be cheaper and easier to make. That means scalability and margin. Better pricing means more insurance coverage, etc. 

2.)  Retatrutide (Phase III, expected submission 2H 2026 ): this is their new blockbuster injectable Triple G agonist. In addition to GLP-1 and GIP, it also targets Glucagon receptors. The main takeaway from this mediation is that it gives around 25% loss in body weight while maintaining lean muscle mass. In fact, grey market reta is routinely abused by body builders. There are cardiac adverse effects that need to be elucidated but all in all it's looking like a blockbuster med just around the corner.

3.) Eloralintide (Phase II): this is their Amylin receptor agonist. Targets another hormone that helps with diabetes and obesity. It is being explored as monotherapy and in combination with Tirzepatide. The combination would traget GLP-1, GIP, and Amylin. You can also imagine they can combine it with Retatrutide and get a Quad Agonist...

4.) Bimagrumab (Phase II): this is their Activin Type II Receptor blocker. This med decreases fat storage and increases muscle growth. It is being studied as a quarterly IV with or without semaglutide, and as a weekly injectable with or without Tirzepatide. This one could be big.

5.) Naperiglipron (Phase II): this is their second small molecule oral GLP-1 agonist. One to watch out for since people think Orforglipron is a dud.

6.) Mazdutide (Phase III in china where LLY relinquished their rights, Phase II for elsewhere): this is their GLP-1/Glucagon dual agonist. Easy to see why they are all in on Reta, but they have this guy in their back pocket.

7.) Nisotirostide (Phase II): this is their NPY2 receptor agonist. It works by suppressing appetite and possibly increased energy expenditure. 

8.) Macupatide (Phase I): this is their GIP agonist. 

9.) ""Oral GGG Peptide"" (Phase I): this could be oral Reta or another new peptide. If both of their small molecule oral GLP-1 agonists fail, then this could be ""the one"".

Analysis of iQIYI ($IQ): Rumored Regulatory Easing in China Could Signal a Major Turnaround,1mu5xbw,Anceradi,2025-08-19 02:15:15,0,0.41,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mu5xbw/analysis_of_iqiyi_iq_rumored_regulatory_easing_in/,"**TL;DR: Rumored regulatory shifts in China could remove major operational handcuffs from iQIYI ($IQ), improving everything from content velocity to monetization. This de-risks the domestic story while their successful Southeast Asia expansion continues to fire on all cylinders. The core bear case just got seriously damaged.**

For those who've been watching Chinese tech, the word ""regulation"" usually means it's time to sell. But the document making the rounds suggests a pivot from crackdown to cultivation. If this holds, the landscape for Chinese media just fundamentally shifted.

**The DD: Key Proposed Changes and What They Actually Mean**

Let's look at the key points from the rumored NRTA memo (https://36kr.com/p/3426978898234753) and translate them into business impact:

**Content Production Freedom:** The big ones are the removal of the 40-episode series limit and easing restrictions on costume/historical dramas. This is huge. It allows $IQ to invest in longer, epic-style series that are proven to drive subscriber loyalty and reduce churn. They can essentially create more of their most popular and addictive content.

**Massive Efficiency Gains:** The talk of a ""review-while-broadcasting"" system and shorter approval timelines is a direct boost to the balance sheet. A huge problem for these companies is the amount of cash tied up in completed shows waiting for a stamp of approval. Faster approvals mean content gets monetized quicker and capital cycles are much more efficient.

**New Revenue Streams:** Officially sanctioning mid-episode ads and supporting short-form ""micro-dramas"" provides two clear paths to diversify revenue beyond subscriptions. This has been a key hurdle on their path to consistent profitability.
**
Unlocking IP:** Allowing adaptations of foreign content (specifically calling out Japan/Korea) is like an IP cheat code. They can now tap into established, popular stories with built-in fanbases, reducing the risk of new productions flopping.

**The Ex-China Growth Engine**

While the domestic story gets de-risked, their Southeast Asia (SEA) operation is already a proven winner. Reports consistently show $IQ, along with Tencent's WeTV, are on their way to overtake Netflix in paid subs across the region. They have a strong product-market fit with their library of C-dramas and K-dramas. The new domestic rules mean they'll have an even stronger pipeline of content to export to these markets.

**The Bull Case Synthesized**

The bull thesis is now a powerful two-pronged attack:

A core domestic business that is being operationally streamlined and de-risked by a more favorable government stance.

A high-growth international arm that is already winning market share and will be fueled by the newly energized domestic content machine.

The risk: The primary risk is that these are, for now, rumored changes. If the NRTA walks them back or they don't get implemented as described, the stock will give back some of these gains. But the signal of a friendlier policy direction is now out there.

**Conclusion**

The 17% pop reflects the market starting to price in this new reality. The primary bear case, unpredictable regulatory headwinds, has potentially been neutralized and even turned into a tailwind. I believe this is the start of a longer-term re-rating for the stock.

Note that the rumors have been discussed on weibo for a few days, and that they're just rumors for now, but the general sentiment is that they will materialize. 

They will not impact the upcoming earnings, but the expansion in SEA might lead to an improved outlook. However I would not recommend basing any decision on ""playing earnings"", as it would be pure gambling, but the stock has a lot of upside, even though it's risky (but so are the classic ASTS, RKLB etc.)

mistake on MSTR calls… need some advice before I torch more $$,1mu5589,YoBordie,2025-08-19 01:41:01,0,0.41,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mu5589/mistake_on_mstr_calls_need_some_advice_before_i/,"So yeah… I’m new to options and already feeling the pain of being naive lol.

A while back I YOLO’d into 2x MSTR Jan 16 ’26 $550 calls at like $40 each (~$8K total). They’re now sitting around $15, and I’m down ~-61% (about -$4.9K). Ouch.

Details:
	•	Exp in Jan 2026 (5 months left)
	•	Break-even is like $566 (lmao, feels miles away)
	•	Delta ~0.22, Theta bleed ~0.16/day
	•	It’s ~5% of my portfolio, not life-ending but definitely stings
	•	My thinking: MSTR = leveraged BTC play, and I’m super bullish on Bitcoin long term

Now I’m stuck wondering:
	1.	Just hold and pray (lottery ticket style).
	2.	Cut my losses now and free up the ~$3K left.
	3.	Roll down into something like $400–$450 strikes to actually have a chance if BTC rips.

What would you guys do? Is rolling worth it or am I just throwing good money after bad? Any tips so I don’t fall into this trap again?

Volkswagen gates a new vehicle’s full horsepower behind monthly subscription,1mtwmw4,WickedSensitiveCrew,2025-08-18 19:55:44,392,0.92,109,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mtwmw4/volkswagen_gates_a_new_vehicles_full_horsepower/,"https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/volkswagen-gating-a-new-vehicles-full-horsepower-behind-monthly-subscription-3239138/

> Volkswagen’s ID3 Pro and Pro S vehicles are some of their latest car models, and, while they look like a typical car the iconic vehicle manufacturer would deliver, there’s a secret under the hood. For both of these models, the maximum horsepower is listed at 228bhp (brake horsepower). However, driving the vehicle normally, you can only push it to 201bhp. In order to get that extra power out of it, you’ll have to pay extra. At around $20 a month, $200 a year, or a lump sum payment of roughly $760 dollars, you can get that full horsepower. And, while it’s difficult to imagine why the ID3 models are limiting themselves and forcing a paywall for users who want to put the pedal to the metal, Volkswagen explained their reasoning behind the change.

> The way that the sub works for their ID3 vehicles is incredibly bizarre. Rather than it being tied to any one driver, the sub is tied to the vehicle. So, for instance, if someone were to pay the full price of buying that power boost for life and they were to sell their ID3 secondhand, whoever got the car next wouldn’t have to pay for it. Volkswagen views the service as a way to offer people more power under the hood without having to sell them a new car.

> “Offering more power to customers is nothing new – historically many petrol and diesel vehicles have been offered with engines of the same size, but with the possibility of choosing one with more potency.

Tesla has been forced to offer discounts of up to 40% to car leasing companies to shift more units, the report said.

The discounts are also due to the lack of storage space for Tesla vehicles in the UK, the report said.

Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Tesla's July sales in the UK fell about 60% to 987 units in July, according to the latest data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

British new car registrations overall fell about 5% year-on-year in July, according to the SMMT.

$NXDR the next social media stock to pop off with improved programmatic ads,1mtqafw,TheOneNeartheTop,2025-08-18 16:06:24,0,0.4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mtqafw/nxdr_the_next_social_media_stock_to_pop_off_with/,"TL;DR: NXDR is RDDT a year early with rising organic traffic, ad model flip to programmatic, $100M in buybacks, $400M cash pile, new (and successful app revamp), and homeowners as a captive ad audience. Market cap only $700M.

**Ad Model Upgrade:**  
Historically, Nextdoor has been selling clunky zip code packages to realtors with little intent, targeting, or efficiency.  But with the launch of NEXT, they've flipped the switch to programmatic ads and even though they are currently intentionally holding back impressions on ads this model is set to skyrocket revenue with proper programmatic ads.  Their new faves section gives deeper scroll depth, higher engagement, and tastiest of all MUCH BETTER CPM's.  This type of switch is a massive boon to revenue per user and for an example of what can happen to revenue per user take a look at what happened to reddit when they improved their ad stack.  This type of advertising upgrade was historically difficult and took a ton of money and talent to build out, but now with AI what used to take a team of engineers years to build can now be prototyped in weeks. A competent self serve ad option isn't the barrier it once was, now it's all about users and NXDR is in around 1/3 of US households.  That's right the tastiest ad dollars, homeowners.  
**Growing demand:**  
The Net Promoter Score is something that NXDR uses to see how likely people are to promote the app to their friends, with their latest switch (in July so not on this quarter yet) they have the highest NPS they've ever had which means that people are liking the new Nextdoor app (this was announced on the earnings call).  This growth has NOT shown up on their quarterly reports but you can see it in google trends where searches for 'nextdoor app' are the highest they've been since the end of 2022.  Additionally searches for Nextdoor Ads are absolutely skyrocketing with their self serve option and are the highest they've ever been (3X this month).  For one more piece of data I took a look at Sensor Tower and their app is now #2 in the app store for News/Social Media which is a leap from their historic spot at around #5.  (Note this is not the pure social media section).

I can't show images on r/stocks but you can do the searches yourself

Here is the [Nextdoor Ads](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=nextdoor%20ads&hl=en) here is the trends for [Nextdoor App](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=nextdoor%20app&hl=en) (Change to 5 years to see the data before the last 90 days).

**Massive Organic (Search) Growth**  
Just like RDDT, Nextdoor is benefiting from googles stance of wanting to push authentic experiences and information.  Their SEMrush chart is showcasing great growth, nearly doubling since January 2023.  But more importantly it's up almost 10% in the last month which is going to push the user growth flywheel.

**Financial Setup**  
They are free cash flow positive for the past 3 quarters and have a cash pile of 400 million with no debt.  This makes it a safe play in these choppy markets as the market cap is only 700 million.  Limited downside, big upside.

**Buybacks!**  
They still have a facility with almost 100 million left in it that expires March 31st and have been retiring shares (using the facility) for the last 2 quarters.  I would expect that they are trying to use up the buybacks before March 31st so this quarter will be the heaviest buyback period.  You can see on the chart that after the date of record of their last quarterly report (june 30th) there has been a great support line trending upwards.  This is the buybacks (likely).  So they are using their great financial position to reduce the float and could retire 250k shares a day from now until March 31st.  At these prices and with their facility they could remove nearly 20% of the float.  With lowering interest rates (potentially) and great response to their new platform, they will be reducing their cash position by reducing the float.

This is almost exactly the setup that Reddit had previously with google pushing organic traffic, organic growth going, and a solid user base.  But what is really going to drive this stock price through the roof is the switch to programmatic ads.  This last gangbusters report for RDDT didn't have stellar user growth compared to previous periods (Q1 31% growth and Q2 21% growth YOY), but what they did have was amazing revenue growth and that is what we are going to see from NXDR.

In these choppy times this play has limited downside (massive cash reserves with FCF positive) and a genuinely massive upside as they can easily increase ad revenue by 50-100%

Air Canada suspends third-quarter and full-year guidance following ‘unlawful’ strike,1mtp0cz,Puginator,2025-08-18 15:20:04,428,0.95,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mtp0cz/air_canada_suspends_thirdquarter_and_fullyear/,"Air Canada is suspending its guidance for third-quarter and full-year operating results after the union defied back-to-work orders, which further halted the airline’s plan to resume flights.

“Air Canada deeply regrets the impact the labour disruption has had on its customers, its stakeholders and the communities it serves,” the airline said in a Monday press release.

More than 10,00 flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday over pay and scheduling disputes. Patty Hajdu, the Minister of Jobs and Families, stepped in and imposed binding arbitration and extended the existing contract until a new agreement could be reached.

The Canadian Industrial Relations Board ordered flight attendants back to work by 2 p.m. ET on Sunday, but the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) told its members to “remain on strike.”

In a statement, union secretary and treasurer Candace Rennick said the government’s order was “a disgraceful misuse of power that reeks of systemic bias and corporate favoritism.”

Because of the union’s defiance, Air Canada said Sunday that it had to cancel about 240 flights scheduled for that day.

All Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights remain cancelled until further notice. Air Canada Express flights operated by Jazz or PAL continue to operate as normal.

The airline estimated that 500,000 customers’ flights have been cancelled because of the strike. Air Canada said in a Monday news release that the board has declared the strike “unlawful” and ordered leadership to direct its members to return to work.

Air Canada said it hopes to resume operations on Monday evening.

The Trump administration on Friday widened the reach of its 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports by adding hundreds of derivative products to the list of goods subject to the levies.
In a Federal Register notice late on Friday, the Commerce Department said the Bureau of Industry and Security was adding 407 product codes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States that identify the goods to be hit with the additional duties on the steel and aluminum content of those products.

The non-steel and non-aluminum content will be subject to the tariff rates President Donald Trump has imposed on the goods originating from specific countries, the notice said.

The levies on the goods on the expanded list go into effect on August 18.

Earlier on Friday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he headed to a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska that he planned additional announcements on steel tariffs and on levies for semiconductor imports.

Neocloud Operators (like $CRWV) Depend on Nvidia Chips Staying Expensive,1mtnfva,WinningWatchlist,2025-08-18 14:21:55,24,0.86,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mtnfva/neocloud_operators_like_crwv_depend_on_nvidia/,">Once upon a very recent time, Nvidia Corp.’s H100 was the crown jewel that everyone in AI was after. A badge of honor in model-training runs, the chip defined an era of bragging rights among artificial intelligence developers. But as Nvidia commits to annual generational leaps, and boss Jensen Huang sells each one as profoundly essential, the question of what to do with older hardware rises in importance.

>CoreWeave Inc., a close partner to Nvidia and one of the newfangled neocloud providers, has an idea for solving that challenge. It’s not glamorous or particularly ingenious, but it neatly ties together the two key processes in AI work - training, the most intensive but briefer operation of cramming information into your AI model, and inference, which is the more voluminous and workmanlike job of querying that library of data to produce hopefully smart-sounding responses. When the time comes to upgrade, CoreWeave just uses the outdated cutting-edge hardware on the simpler job.

>“What happens is, the prior generation begins to pick up the load on inference,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Intrator told me last week. “We are not seeing meaningful declines in H100 demand, which is the prior generation of the Grace Blackwell, which is the cutting edge right now.”

>There’s what he called “broad-based inference demand absorbing that compute” - compute being the industry term for computational power. Many of the same customers shopping for the most advanced chips for their model training are also “looking to support the ever-growing demands of inference.”

>That’s one of the biggest deployers of Nvidia’s high-performance compute making the case that we don’t need the very latest for every task. Inference has proven friendly to hardware that’s one cycle old. If CoreWeave is right, the real economic story of GPUs may be not just the rush to the newest silicon, but the expanding afterlife of what might have been considered obsolete.

>CoreWeave sits at the center of that story. It isn’t a fully-formed hyperscaler in the mold of Amazon Web Services ot Microsoft Corp.’s Azure; its neocloud designation refers to how tailored its infrastructure is for AI workloads.

>The business model is simple in theory, punishing in practice: borrow heavily to build specialized data centers, line up customers like OpenAI and Microsoft, and rent compute at scale. It’s high-growth, but it’s also high-risk - utilization has to stay very high to cover the financing, and the resale value of yesterday’s silicon matters a lot more than in the hyperscaler world.

>That’s why H100s showing up in the secondary market are worth watching. Resales - and their price - may either validate or cast some doubt on CoreWeave’s reasoning.

>Hyperscalers rotate out old hardware quickly; for them, training always moves to the latest chips and inference often runs cheaper elsewhere. Neocloud operators face more pressure. Miss utilization targets, or buckle under financing costs, and you’ll have to start selling off the hardware as a release valve. The result: racks of lightly used H100s hitting the market at steep discounts, reminding everyone that obsolescence in this business comes on a 12–18 month cycle.

>All of that landed with a thud on Wall Street this past week. CoreWeave reported widening losses, surging capex, and an outlook that spooked investors who had bid the stock up severalfold since its IPO. Shares slumped 21% the day after earnings and gave up another 15% the following day. The message was clear: demand for AI compute may be unprecedented, but scaling fast enough to meet it - without crushing margins - is proving harder than the hype cycle suggested.

>The obsession with cutting-edge hardware makes for flashy launches, investor buzz, and multibillion-dollar stock swings. But the deeper story may be how older generations of silicon are repurposed - whether by neocloud operators wringing inference value out of the previously prized GPUs or hyperscalers rotating stock into resale markets.

Comcast Gets Serious About Subscriber Losses - A Long Fight Looms,1mtlpzw,WinningWatchlist,2025-08-18 13:14:46,214,0.94,161,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mtlpzw/comcast_gets_serious_about_subscriber_losses_a/,"Comcast Corp. has a problem - the company is losing customers in its most significant business, providing internet access to nearly 30 million American households.

The Philadelphia-based telecom and media conglomerate has reported record losses of broadband subscribers for three straight quarters, more than half a million accounts in total, after pandemic-related federal subsidies for low-income customers ended and telecom companies like T-Mobile US Inc. got much more aggressive offering consumers alternative options.

Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts and his team have jumped into action, bringing in new management at the broadband division, introducing new pricing plans and pushing harder into other products, such as wireless phone service, to complement their internet offerings and cable TV. Still, there’s no immediate end in sight to the cancellations.

“We’re not offering predictions around when they’ll get back to positive adds,’’ Chief Financial Officer Jason Armstrong said in an interview. “But everything we’re doing now is designed to put us back on a much better trajectory.”

For years the company founded by Roberts’ father with the purchase of a single pay-TV franchise in Tupelo, Mississippi, was the king of cable. But as consumers have canceled those pricey TV packages in favor of streaming services like Netflix Inc., Comcast’s video business has shriveled. At 11.8 million, the company’s cable-TV customers amount to fewer than half their peak in 2008. With that business shrinking, Comcast no longer has the easy sell of asking a cable customer to sign up for internet access too.

“Pay TV cord-cutting was really the catalyst that started impacting broadband because you’re no longer in a bundle,” said streaming media consultant Dan Rayburn. “And the value was always in the bundle.”

Comcast got a boost during the pandemic, along with other providers, as consumers realized they couldn’t function without reliable home internet. Short-lived federal subsidies for internet access also helped Comcast add broadband customers between 2020 and 2022. But the tide began to turn for the company in mid-2023.

T-Mobile, AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. have been tapping their wireless networks to deliver internet access at prices that attract budget-conscious consumers. The big three telecom carriers added over 900,000 so-called fixed-wireless accounts in the second quarter alone. Comcast and its peers have historically provided Internet access through a mix of fiber and coaxial cable connections, but the three major telecom companies have also been investing in speedy fiber-optic lines right to the home.

The pressure has forced Comcast management to respond on several fronts. The company has been offering cheaper plans at slower speeds for low-income consumers. In April, Comcast introduced a new internet pricing program for all customers, including a 5-year price guarantee. Plans start at $55 a month, including taxes and equipment fees. The new pitch is a departure from the strategy of the past, which typically involved discounting a customer’s first year or two and then applying a steep increase in monthly charges.

The company has also stepped up promotion of its wireless phone service. Subscribers to the 5-year internet plan get a free mobile line for one year. Under a long-running deal with Verizon and increasing use of its own infrastructure, Comcast is able to undercut its competitors with a lower-priced mobile offering, according to Armstrong. The company added a record 378,000 wireless lines in the second quarter.

The theory is that internet customers will stick with Comcast, thanks to the price guarantee, and ultimately pay for wireless phone service too. Early signs suggest that customers are also choosing faster speeds, and thus more costly internet plans, an encouraging trend, according to Armstrong.

“Right now the No. 1 product attaching to broadband is wireless,’’ he said. “That is the bundle of the future.”

The company has reorganized management of its connectivity business in the US, promoting Steve Croney to chief operating officer and hiring Jon Gieselman, a former Apple Inc. and DirecTV executive, as chief growth officer. It’s also taking steps to improve customer service.

Broadband troubles aside, Comcast has other businesses that it is investing in, including theme parks and business telecom services, and has managed to increase revenue every year since 2020. Later in 2025, it will spin off cable-TV networks such as MSNBC and USA, cutting a loose a business where subscriber revenue and advertising are challenged by the shift to streaming. Comcast has said its growth businesses, including residential broadband, will account for 65% of revenue after that separation is complete.

While the company works on its broadband problem, sales are forecast to be little changed this year and rise 3% in 2026. Unless there’s a turnaround, 2025 will go down as the fourth losing year for Comcast shares in the past five - with the stock down about 11% year to date, compared with an 10% gain for the S&P 500 Index.

“This is not a quick fix,” said Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics. “This is a multiyear technical and cultural shift. And culture is very hard to change.”

$APLD - 10 bagger AI DATA CENTER,1msh3o5,MGunMike,2025-08-17 04:08:44,203,0.88,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1msh3o5/apld_10_bagger_ai_data_center/,"APLD is positioning themselves as one of the few players building the kind of high-performance data centers that AI workloads actually demand. We're talking racks stacked with GPU's pulling power at a massive scale.

On paper, they've got around 400MW scheduled to come online nby 2027. That's just what's already been announced. Management has been clear that if they can line up more power, they'll keep scaling aggressively. And when you run the numbers, the revenue potential starts looking pretty wild.

Here's the simple math: industry rates for high-performance hosting earn about $.35 to $.50 per watt per month, with AI workloads usually toward the higher end. Annualied that's $6,000 per kW, or $6M per MW. Multiply that by 400 MW and you're looking at roughly $2.4B in yearly revenue potential.

Even if you haircut that for more conservative assumptions- say $.40/watt and a 45% margin - it still works out to a business throwing off serious cash. Data center operators at scale tend to run 50% EBITDA margins, so $2.4B in revenue would translate into \~1.2B in EBITDA. And right now the market is valuing infrastructure names feeding the AI boom at 10-20x EBITDA. That points to a market cap anywhere from $12B on the low end to north of $20B if they execute well.

The bigger lever, though, is capacity. If they can find another 200-300 MW to build out on top of the 400 MW roadmap, the earnings power scales dramatically. The real bottleneck here isn't GPUs - it's electricity. APLD's edge is that their sites are in power-friendly locations where expansion is actually possible.

I originally came across this stock while doing some modeling work on NVDA for a client. CoreWeave, which NVDA owns a stake in, cut a deal with APLD not long ago - and the stock ripped up 50%. APLD is essentially a landlord, and companies like CoreWeave are the tenants, leasing AI power.

THIS IS NOT FINANICAL ADVISE. JUST MY THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS. 

1. Innodata $INOD

What is Innodata? Innodata is a data engineering company that trains Ai. Ever heard of Alexander wangs company ScaleAi that teamed up with META? Or $NBIS’s Toloka? Or Google poaching windsurfs employees? They all do the same thing. Train Ai to learn. Innodata works with META, GOOGLE, APPLE, Xai, and more tech companies. They basically have 0 debt. And  revenues up 79% YoY. Raised guidance last quarter and CEO Jack stated there’s pretty much pipelines in place for growth. Market cap is less than 1.5Billion. With big techs Ai spend and increasing CapEx guidance, I see a booming company in a booming sector. 

2. $BROS Dutch Bros Coffee
A coffee chain that is very popular and growing in America. They are expanding rapidly throughout America, they started on the west coast and are quickly expanding east. Revenue growth of 30% YoY, last quarterly results basically confirmed to me that they can manage the growth while keeping debt under control. What’s even more bullish to me is that same store sales is increasing in a weak consumer spending environment. Starbucks same store sales are down for like the 6th quarter in a row, chipotle missed earnings. But Dutch bros rev is up, same store sales is up. This is super bullish to me. And to my knowledge they haven’t even expanded outside of the U.S. this is also there first FcF positive quarter. 

Would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these companies.

Also would love to hear your opinion on your most bullish companies!

Thomson Reuters Q1 Beat but Is It Really That Impressive?,1mrq9ki,Front-Recording7391,2025-08-16 09:27:47,2,0.54,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mrq9ki/thomson_reuters_q1_beat_but_is_it_really_that/,"Thomson Reuters just reported Q1 2025 results with total revenue up 1% and organic revenue up 6%. The so-called ""Big 3"" segments posted an even stronger 9% organic growth, which is getting a lot of the usual bullish headlines right now.

But honestly, I’m not fully convinced this is as great as it sounds. Sure, organic growth looks good on paper, but a 1% total revenue increase feels pretty muted for a company of this size and scope. It makes me wonder if the headline numbers are masking some underlying softness or if there’s reliance on a few strong segments rather than broad-based strength. 

Also, the market usually prices in these kinds of steady but unspectacular beats pretty quickly. What really matters is if institutional sponsorship is clearly visible on the charts. Without that, all the nice press releases and growth percentages won't move the needle much. I've seen too many cases where the story looks good but the volume and big-money activity tell a different tale.

Are traders just glossing over the lack of meaningful top-line acceleration here? Or is there something else creeping into the valuation that the surface numbers don’t show?

What might Trumpian meddling mean for Intel?,1mrklgt,RiKeiJin,2025-08-16 04:24:20,95,0.73,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mrklgt/what_might_trumpian_meddling_mean_for_intel/,">What Intel needs more than new board members is customers for its manufacturing, or “foundry”, arm. They have not been forthcoming, partly because Intel’s chip-design business competes with would-be buyers such as AMD and Nvidia. A second transaction offers some clues as to how they might be persuaded. In July America’s Defence Department invested $400m in MP Materials, a producer of rare-earth metals, and will guarantee the price it receives for its output at above-market rates. A few days later Apple, involved in its own negotiations with the president, also announced a supply agreement with MP Materials. Mr Trump may demand that chip designers such as AMD and Nvidia, which rely on his approval to sell their products in China, use Intel’s manufacturing. A more radical option could see him force them to club together and purchase Intel’s struggling foundry business. That’s a deal any activist would be proud of pulling off.

If *The Economist*’s prediction comes true, which customers will Trump find for the 18A process? If Trump even goes so far as to force U.S. companies to adopt the 14A process, will Intel revive its foundry investments in 14A?

ASTS - Debunking the “120 Mbps not enough for video” argument,1mr5whs,you_are_wrong_tho,2025-08-15 18:20:24,0,0.36,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mr5whs/asts_debunking_the_120_mbps_not_enough_for_video/,"Argument I am seeing a lot is everyone who subscribes to ASTS won’t be able to stream 4k video all at once. Yeah no shit, you can’t even do that on a terrestrial 5g when it’s jam packed Friday night at 9pm.

Are you going to be able to do online gaming in the middle of the desert by hot spotting from your phone? probably not, but that’s what something like starlink is for.

Google says most video live streaming uses 1.1mbps.

Alright, how often are you video calling someone when you are not connected to WiFi?

How often are you trying to use Spotify or Google maps or making a phone call, or some other application when not connected to WiFi? A lot more often. How about browsing instagram? This is the main use case that MOST people will use the service for most of the time.

Google Maps typically uses between 0.5 and 5 MB of data per HOUR for standard navigation.

Spotify's data usage, and thus its Mbps, depends on the streaming quality setting. For the lowest quality (24 kbps), it uses around 0.03 Mbps. For normal quality (96 kbps), it uses about 0.12 Mbps. High quality (160 kbps) uses approximately 0.2 Mbps, and very high quality (320 kbps), used by premium subscribers, uses around 0.4 Mbps

A voice call uses 0.064 mbps, while some codes can use as little as 8kbps (0.008 mbps).

General browsing on instagram uses 120-300mb per HOUR.

Live-streaming on instagram uses 1.1mbps (same as a video call).

YOUTUBE uses 1.1-2.5 Mbps for 480p video streaming.

The average population in a 450 km2 area in the US is approximately 16200 people.

A single beam (assuming total us coverage of 45-60 sats) will provide 120mbps. Once full constellation is up and a mesh network is  built (250 sats), you now have 4.166x-5.55x more throughput per 450 km2. Up to 666mbps per 450 km2.

With an average population density of 16200 people in 450 square kilometers (this includes high density areas, which is not the target for asts at this time. the density of those less populated areas will actually be less than the 16200 number), if 10% of the population is using ASTS’s service at the same time, that gives those 1620 people 0.411 Mbps each to utilize. More than enough for the low data apps you normally use.

Thats more than enough for that 10% to use Google maps, Spotify, and make a phone call and browse instagram ALL AT THE SAME TIME. Or, 1/5 of those people can all WATCH YOUTUBE AT THE SAME TIME. Or 1/3 of those people can all video call…AT THE SAME TIME!

And this is assuming there is no jump above the current limit of 120mbps by the time we get 250 sats up.

These numbers were all calculated assuming 250 sats (end game constellation). Yes, these numbers will be less when there are less sats up, duh.

You can do your own calculations now based on how many sats are up at any given time.",2025-08-15,0.6077,Positive,"['ASTS', 'MOST', 'MB', 'HOUR', 'HOUR', 'US', 'ASTS', 'ALL', 'AT', 'THE', 'SAME', 'TIME', 'WATCH', 'AT', 'THE', 'SAME', 'TIME', 'AT', 'THE', 'SAME', 'TIME']"

Some people are surviving on gig type jobs altogether (Uber, food delivery etc). Some people are not collecting unemployment benefits, so they don’t show up in the statistics. Just look around: ghost jobs, 7 interview rounds for one position, tens of thousands of people being laid off at once.

* Cracks in the housing market

* AI bubble

I’m not an AI hater, but it’s clear that people have overestimated its capabilities. We’re not getting anything close to AGI anytime soon. Also, GPT5 is not much better than GPT4 in terms of quality, the advancements were made in efficiency – for good reason: AI companies are moving away from market acquisition and into figuring out how to monetize all of this, so investors get their money back. Even if the bubble doesn’t pop in the traditional sense, we can certainly expect some form of plateau and investor reluctance going forward.

Big tech is 40% of the S&P500 and all of them are riding the AI wave.

* Tariffs

Tariffs damage the economy. They are inflationary and reduce trade. Anyone thinking US workers are going to be assembling phones is delusional, so all they will do is increase the cost of doing business. Eventually, this will be transferred to the consumer. 

One reason this hasn’t truly happened yet is because companies stocked up on inventory before the tariffs hit, while other companies paid their mob protection tax to Trump to avoid tariffs, at least in the short term.

* Cracks in car market

[While overall car sales seem to be up from 2024](https://www.carpro.com/blog/first-half-of-2025-u.s.-auto-sales-all-automakers-reporting), it's [fueled by credit](https://www.edmunds.com/industry/press/a-record-1-in-5-new-car-shoppers-committed-to-a-1000-monthly-payment-in-q2-2025-according-to-edmunds.html) and [panic-buying before tariffs](https://www.investopedia.com/have-americans-been-panic-buying-cars-to-get-ahead-of-tariff-driven-price-hikes-11709204), not a financially healthy consumer. Anecdotal evidence from various dealers around the country seem to support a slowdown in the past couple of months. Otherwise they [wouldn't be dropping prices](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SETA02).

* Consumer credit bomb

Anyone saying “consumer is still strong” isn’t paying attention.

The [buy-now-pay-later market growth looks like a staircase](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/buy-now-pay-later-market-report). 

[41% of BNPL consumers made at least one late payment in the past year](https://www.emarketer.com/content/bnpl-popularity-among-young-risks). The [US household debt has been skyrocketing as well](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc) in recent years. I concede that this chart looked similar after covid as well, but consumer credit bomb is a factor and it has to explode at some point. 

Even if it doesn't explode in the traditional sense, all of this is essentially pulling demand from tomorrow.

* US tourism decline

Who the hell wants to go to the US to be detained at the border for a JD Vance meme? It’s simply not worth it.

* Ukraine war climax

Currently, the two sides are irreconcilable, which means it must get worse before it gets better. I don’t know what form this will take. Maybe Ukraine falls and Russia has to deal with guerilla warfare for years to come, maybe the Russian government collapses instead, causing a power vacuum and crisis in the process. Whatever form this will take, it will negatively impact the world economy in some way. This is on top of the general outlook held by everyone that global tensions and trade distortions means growth decelerates or even stalls.

* The fed has no wiggle room

Some might say that the fed will just cut rates and that will fuel the stock market. I disagree. The fed cannot cut rates meaningfully in an inflationary environment. The [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) says 90% chance of rate cuts. Hot take: I disagree. They won't cut rates. They can't. [Fed officials agree with me](https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-kugler-no-rate-cut-some-time-tariffs-pass-through-prices-2025-07-17/), for what it's worth.

* Institutional collapse of credibility

Nobody trusted the government before Trump either, but it seems we reached new highs. Every single position in the US government has been filled by phony, unqualified charlatans. One thing they have in common is that they’re loyal to Trump. He just fired the head of the BLS after he didn’t like the numbers they published. Making data-driven decisions will become increasingly difficult. 

The ripple effects of all this are unquantifiable and probably too vast to list here. Some come to mind: risk premiums explode, capital flees, big corporations freeze and employ a “wait for this to blow over” strategy (stockpile cash, freeze hiring etc). Institutions are the backbone of democracies.

* **Let’s talk timeline**

All in all, everyone knows things are bad. I just listed some of the issues I could think of. There’s probably more.

Here’s what I’m thinking in terms of how and when this will play out:

**Phase 1 (Q3 2025 – Q4 2025): Late Cycle Euphoria**

- AI narrative still holds for the moment. S&P500 continues to grind higher fueled by big cap tech giants keeping the AI dream alive.
- Firing workers still boosts a company's stock price as they are perceived to be “trimming the fat” from the covid over-hiring as well as thinking that AI will fill the gaps.
- Effects of tariffs not yet in full swing. Previous over-stocking holds.
- Overall market inertia keeps things going for a bit.

**Phase 2 (Q1 2026 – Q2 2026): Trump Rally Peak**

- Tariffs are fully embedded in prices, squeezing the consumer to the max.
- By now, even the most dedicated supporters are starting to realize that Trump will not “fix it”. Tariffs aren’t being rolled back. 
- The belief that Trump is “good for the stock market” begins to fade as reality sets in.
- AI hype cracks as monetization disappoints and people realize it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.
- Market peaks, investors begin to sell every bounce on the way down, but some people still hold on to the belief that these are just normal market fluctuations, no need to panic.

**Phase 3 (Q3 2026 – Q4 2026): Sentiment Crack**

- Political pressure mounts as economy continues to deteriorate.
- Fed can’t cut meaningfully due to sticky inflation. “Fed is stuck” narrative takes shape.
- Consumer spending falls sharply.
- “Sell the Trump rally” sentiment begins to dominate. 
- S&P500 goes down 20%.

**Phase 4 (Q1 2027): Capitulation event**

- Trump either dies or is impeached, or some other major political shock happens.
- Credit-sensitive sectors go bankrupt.
- Inflation finally subsides as demand collapses.
- VIX up 50%.
- Fed signals “emergency measures” as unemployment skyrockets even in worthless government statistics.
- S&P500’s final leg down is 35-45% from the current top.

**How does recovery look like?**

Well, not great. What are the factors that would fuel a rally back up? The only one that I can think of right now is that stock prices will overshoot the bottom and some things may just be “too cheap to not buy”.

Would a political change help? Maybe, but I don’t see the government suddenly reforming. 

AI-fatigue followed by a return to human-centric work? We might see a short-lived “human over machine” sentiment but I don’t think that’ll be enough to fuel any meaningful economic recovery.

Tariff rollback and a big enough collapse to give consumers some breathing room might also be a helping factor in the recovery, but still, I feel like it’s lacking the systemic impact we’re looking for in a V shaped recovery.

Rather, I think that the recovery is L shaped, similar to Japan 1990s or US 2000 - 2007. We slowly grind upwards from the bottom and we get back to current prices by 2030. However, if you account for inflation, you'd still be underwater if you bought the S&P500 now.

**TL;DR:** Stock market has to reconcile with reality in the next couple of years, causing a massive correction. “Sell the Trump rally” narrative takes shape next year.

Trump Administration Eyeing Chips Act Funds for Intel Stake,1mqyyu5,WinningWatchlist,2025-08-15 14:10:44,262,0.95,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mqyyu5/trump_administration_eyeing_chips_act_funds_for/,">The Trump administration is considering using funds from the US Chips Act to take a stake in the beleaguered American chipmaker Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the discussions.

>The government’s talks focus on using Chips Act funding to at least partially finance an equity stake in Intel, the people said, while emphasizing that discussions are in early stages and other options could be under consideration. It’s unclear if the approach would involve converting some or all of Intel’s existing Chips Act grants into equity, allocating new funding from a broader pool or combining chips act money with other financing streams.

>Intel was already poised to be the biggest beneficiary of money from the Chips Act, having been earmarked for billions of dollars in grants. Under the program, the company was awarded $7.9 billion in grants for commercial semiconductor manufacturing and as much as an additional $3 billion for the Pentagon’s Secure Enclave program. It also has the option to draw on an additional $11 billion in loans under the 2022 law.

>The source of funding, which has not been previously reported, remain in discussion and talks are fluid, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations.Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan, who met with Donald Trump Monday, is also said to be secure in his position despite the president’s previous criticisms, the people said.The Trump administration is looking to quickly deploy dormant Chips funding to sectors it deems central to US national security, another said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The Commerce Department and Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

>Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the Trump administration was weighing a stake in the Santa Clara, California-based company. At the time, a White House spokesperson said any hypothetical deals are speculation until there’s an official announcement.The talks are the latest in a winding saga over the company and its major Ohio chips manufacturing facility, which has been beset by delays. It’s also the latest case of Trump directly inserting himself in industrial policy and looking for a stake or cut in major deals.The talks come just a week after Trump called for the ouster of Tan, accusing him of being “highly conflicted” because of concerns about his earlier ties to China.

>The plans stem from the meeting this week between Trump and Tan, the people said. While the details are still being sorted, the idea is for the US government to pay for the stake, one of the people said. Another cautioned that the plans remain fluid. The talks could still end without an agreement.

>Shares of Intel rose as much as 5.3% after markets opened on Friday.Intel on Thursday declined to comment on the discussions. In a statement, a representative said the company is “deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership.”

>**Direct Intervention**

>Any agreement would bolster Intel’s finances at a time when the company has been slashing spending and cutting jobs.

>It’s the latest direct intervention floated by Trump’s administration into a key industry. The administration reached an agreement to receive a 15% cut of certain semiconductor sales to China and took a so-called golden share in United States Steel Corp. as part of a deal to clear its sale to a Japanese rival.

>The Intel idea also echoes the Defense Department’s unprecedented announcement last month that it will take a $400 million preferred equity stake in the little-known US rare-earth producer  - a deal that would make the Pentagon the company’s largest shareholder, with a roughly 15% stake of the firm’s shares. That move turned conventional wisdom on its head among investors, analysts, industry executives and even longtime government officials in terms of how private industry has dealt with the government.

>These unconventional efforts by the federal government also aren’t expected to be one-time deals, Bloomberg News has previously reported, with Trump and his administration adamant about boosting domestic champions in sectors it deems critical to combating China on national security grounds.“In the past few months, we’ve seen the government take a much more active role in engaging the economy, a much more sort of hands-on industrial policy,” said Geoffrey Gertz, senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “That appears to be the current direction for US industrial policy in these critical sectors,” he told Bloomberg Television.

>Some deals by the administration are being potentially fashioned on the MP Materials blueprint, one of the people said. That means an equity investment, guaranteed purchases, loans and private financing, alongside government partnership. The view by many within the administration is that such levers give full confidence to investors that a project has the backing of the most creditworthy institution in the world, while also providing cover to taxpayers’ money.

>**Financial Woes**

>A chip industry pioneer, Intel has struggled in recent years, hurt by the loss of market share and its technological edge. Tan’s predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, touted the Ohio factory expansion as part of a comeback plan.But Intel’s financial woes have imperiled the project. Earlier this year, the build-out was delayed until the 2030s, and the company said in July that it would further slow the Ohio plan. Since taking over in March, Tan has focused more on getting Intel’s financial house in order.The Chips Act program has been in flux under Trump.

>Earlier this year, administration officials floated the idea of having chip-production powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. operate Intel’s factories as part of a joint venture. But TSMC CEO C. C. Wei has said that his company plans to remain focused on its own business.Trump has won Ohio in all three of his presidential elections, and Republicans flipped a Senate seat there in 2024. Vice President JD Vance served as a senator from the state. Former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown is seeking election there again next year, making the state something of a battleground once again, though it has trended steadily toward Republicans.

I'm not sure if I can link it here, I'll throw it into a comment just to be safe.

But the gist of it is China has funded a company that is trying to remove CUDA from the equation in the next 18-24 months which means all of the China revenue NVDA would generate would implode and who knows if the tech is cheaper and works better (or marginally worse but still by value is stronger) they could become a dominant player in the chips market.

There are a TON of factors that could either make this more or less legitimate of a concern but I thought it was something to keep an eye on.

**Edit:** oh my comment with the link got removed, DM if you want to read the blog (no stupid paywall).

**Edit2:** I'm seeing a lot of people misunderstanding, China is not trying to out compete NVDA in the market, they are funding a company to develop an alternative to CUDA that would be used inside of China by necessity and thus cut off China as a market for NVDA except for black market but that isn't going to be a very strong revenue source.

So the saga continues.

UNH is up over 11% in premarket as of writing. This bodes extremely well for the health insurance sector, and likely the entire insurance sector overall. Insurance stocks that haven't really seen some love, are likely going to be a hot trade for the next few months.

ROOT insurance is very similar to an early Geico play and trades at a 1.4B mcap. its a tech, ai, & insurance combination so it offers both the alpha and a long term buy and hold prospect. thats my pick.

Intel stock is still cheap after the move,1mqxkxv,SlamedCards,2025-08-15 13:17:25,0,0.47,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mqxkxv/intel_stock_is_still_cheap_after_the_move/,"Intel has two businesses. Chip design and Foundry business 

The chip design business did 12.7 billion in trailing 1 year operating income. This includes consumer CPU business and Data Center CPU business (and hope for AI GPU in future)

Intel's Foundry business lost 13 billion last year. The company 
has repeated that (before last couple days news). That they could get the foundry business on their own to breakeven by end of 2027, from their own products.

Obviously making 0 money is not optimal, and not sustainable for that business. But that would push Intel's operating income back to 13 billion.

Now the government is going to take a stake in company. Intel is only using half of their capacity in Arizona, and Ohio fab is also empty (why it's been delayed) due to a lack of customers.

Now Trump is going to make companies use Intel to avoid tariffs (in my opinion) so that these fabs continue to get built. It's also political, the more fabs are made in Ohio, it helps Trump in midterms and Vance in 2028. 

If Foundry business goes from 0 operating income to instead doing like 8 billion a year (reasonable return on a 2, 30 billion dollar factories). Intel could be earning 20+ billion a year in 2028. Market cap is 100 billion right now! That's 5 times earnings 

Also just imagine the constant pump, the more Trump does for Intel, the more the government makes and the more jobs it creates.

Pimco’s Warning on a Fannie-Freddie IPO: ‘Don’t Fix What Is Not Broken’,1mqxc35,WinningWatchlist,2025-08-15 13:07:32,25,0.84,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mqxc35/pimcos_warning_on_a_fanniefreddie_ipo_dont_fix/,">Pacific Investment Management Co. is warning that the Trump administration’s plan to sell shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could drive up the mortgage rates that Americans pay.

>“Don’t fix what is not broken,” Libby Cantrill, Pimco’s head of public policy, wrote in a note to clients earlier this week. She said that unless the sale can be orchestrated in a way that preserves the government’s commitment to financially support the institutions, investor demand may cool for the mortgage-backed securities that they sell. And this, Cantrill said, would in turn make home loans more expensive for millions of people.

>Her warning follows a recent estimate by Citigroup Inc. strategists that mortgage rates are likely to rise 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point following privatization. At the upper end, that would equate to roughly $600 a year in extra interest payments for the average borrower, yet another burden on families already getting priced out of the housing market at a record pace.

>The US is planning to re-list Fannie and Freddie in a process that could start later this year and raise about $30 billion, almost two decades after seizing control of them to stave off catastrophic losses during the financial crisis. The pair have for generations played a key role in fostering US home ownership by buying mortgages from banks, packaging them into bonds and providing investors guarantees against missed payments.

>Yet efforts to potentially release them from US oversight, known as conservatorship, face numerous obstacles, and any missteps could dent market confidence in the government’s support, industry observers warn. Trump officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, have in recent months said that preventing any increase in mortgage rates is a top priority.

>“It’s a hard puzzle to solve, especially in a short amount of time,” said David Brickman, a former chief executive officer of Freddie Mac. “Releasing them from conservatorship without raising mortgage rates is difficult, if you’re not providing a more explicit guarantee” or “expanding the ways they can make money.”

>Representatives for the Treasury and FHFA didn’t respond to requests seeking comment.

>Investors in the more than $6 trillion agency MBS market appear to be taking at face value efforts by the administration to ease concerns over potential disruptions - including a promise

>by President Donald Trump himself to maintain the government’s so-called implicit guarantee of the companies. Risk premiums on MBS have barely budged in recent months, suggesting traders remain confident Fannie and Freddie would be backstopped by the government should the pair run into trouble again, even after privatization.

>For more MBS coverage, subscribe to the Structured Finance Weekly

>That’s not to say, however, that MBS buyers shouldn’t take Pimco’s warnings seriously.

>The asset management giant, which oversees more than $2 trillion, wrote that the market “may become nervous if an explicit guarantee is not more locked-in.” Investor confidence that the US stands behind the companies is one reason they demand relatively little compensation to own mortgage bonds, which in turn keeps home-loan rates from rising.

>Cantrill also drew attention to bond market plumbing rules that let Fannie and Freddie pool mortgages without requiring investors to discriminate between the two companies. That system, which is known as the uniform mortgage-backed securities market and has been in place since 2019, works because the government backs bundles of home loans regardless of whether they come from Fannie or Freddie.

>In her note Cantrill referred to a May report in which she wrote that this fungibility would be in doubt without explicit government backing following Fannie and Freddie’s release, creating “friction that would almost certainly lead to higher mortgage rates.”

>Citigroup says another risk to mortgage rates comes from the fact the two companies will face strong incentives to increase profitability to make an IPO appealing to potential investors.

>One of their main sources of revenue is the fee they charge bond buyers, known as the guarantee fee, in exchange for their promise to compensate them for any missed principal and interest on the MBS they bundle. That fee could increase by around 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point following privatization in a base case scenario, and then be passed through via mortgage rates, Citigroup estimated.

>“The thinking here is if you’re privatizing then how do you make them more attractive to investors? You’d need to increase returns. There are ways to do that other than raising guarantee fees, but that is the simplest option,” said Ankur Mehta, a strategist at the New York-based bank, adding that raising fees may come at the expense of market share.

>In the event the government provided neither an implicit nor explicit guarantee of Fannie and Freddie, mortgage rates could rise as much as 0.8 percentage point, according to Citigroup’s estimates, although Mehta said he views such a scenario as unlikely.

>**Key Obstacles**

>Of course, many details of how the administration might go about privatizing Fannie and Freddie aren’t yet known. It’s possible it could ultimately have a negligible impact on mortgage rates, or even cause rates to fall slightly, especially if the government were to offer an explicit guarantee, Citigroup and others have said.

>However, any such assurance would likely require an act of Congress, a remote prospect given partisan gridlock in Washington, according to many industry observers.

>What’s more, market watchers have been quick to point out that there are still a number of significant issues that need to be addressed before an IPO can proceed.

>For example, even after accruing profits for years Fannie and Freddie are still about $200 billion short of capital they’d need to pull off a public listing, “calling into question potential investor demand” for such an offering, Pimco’s Cantrill wrote. Capital rules could be overhauled but that would require regulatory changes, she said.

>The administration may also need to forge guidelines for Fannie and Freddie that define their scope after a public offering, if it’s also giving shareholders a greater say over the business model, according to Donald Layton, who preceded Brickman as chief executive officer of Freddie Mac. The absence of such safeguards before 2008 is one reason the pair ended up pouring money into subprime mortgages, a move that ultimately necessitated a government rescue, Layton wrote in an April post for New York University’s Furman Center.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

- On a year-over-year basis, Japan’s GDP expanded 1.2% in the second quarter.

- The GDP beat can be mainly attributed to net exports, which contributed 0.3 percentage points to GDP.

Japan’s economy expanded 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025 from the previous first three months, outpacing forecasts despite tariff headwinds out of the United States.

This was compared to the revised 0.1% growth seen in the first quarter, and was higher than the 0.1% increase expected by economists polled by Reuters.

The GDP beat was mainly attributed to resilience in exports, which added 0.3 percentage points to GDP growth, compared to the 0.8% contraction in the first quarter of the year. Japan’s trade deficit narrowed from April to June compared to the first quarter, according to data from the country’s trade ministry.

By taking a vacation --- a long one ""

That made me want to  look more closely at what has been going on with my own portfolio.

I used Yahoo Finance free portfolio tracking tools to make a hypothetical portfolio to see what would have happened if I could go back in time and  freeze my accounts at a certain time years ago.

It shows that I would have done a lot better.

Yahoo Finance was extremely helpful here , but it's not perfect,  It works well enough that I was able to find out what I needed to know for now , but i will be wanting to do more Hypothetical  portfolios in the future.

Its very time  consuming to get set up and it's probably not 100% accurate , once you get it set up its , quick and easy to use ,

If  there are  company buyouts , splits , name and ticker changes ,etc , it gets complicated, you have to search for the information and make a lot of changes.

I think this would be very helpful to a lot of people if  it were better able to handle these things better.

EDIT: There are lots and lots of these apps but so far none of the ones that i have tried will have any information on any companies that have been bought out or even if it just had a name or ticker change , it gives you nothing.

What I'm trying to do is find a more efficient way to test whether  the performance of a portfolio would have been better had the securities been just held for a number of years .

This would be very useful for anyone who has been trading stocks (whether it be an individual or professional ) that has been under performing the market. If you go back year by year you could be able tell if A) you have been picking good companies and you just need to let the winners run,  B) stop trading and put all your money in a market tracking fund  or C) Well , there are many other things that could be a 3rd option ,

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake in troubled insurer UnitedHealth after secretly building the position for two quarters in a row, according to a regulatory filing.

The Omaha-based conglomerate bought more than 5 million shares in the health care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June. The size is relatively small for Berkshire, whose equity portfolio is worth about $300 billion, so it could be the work of Buffett’s two investing lieutenants Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

There was much speculation about the mystery position before Thursday with many guessing it would be a defense name. The confidential treatment allowed Berkshire to quietly build up a position and limit price movement without stoking volatility.

The move came just months after the fund dramatically boosted its Alibaba stake in the first quarter by more than 3,360% to $748.4 million from $21.6 million.

The retreat coincided with renewed tariff tensions between Washington and Beijing. On Monday, the two governments extended their trade truce by 90 days, narrowly averting a tariff hike.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing new duties until November 10, while China reciprocated, keeping existing tariffs, 30% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and 10% on U.S. goods to China, in place. The extension, following earlier threats of duties above 100%, temporarily cools a dispute that had intensified earlier this year.

They’re still pre revenue and burning a ton of cash *($176M in op expenses this quarter, +45% YoY)*. Net loss was $206M, though ~$82M was just non cash warrant liability stuff. The good news? They raised $850M, bringing their cash pile to ~$1.7B, enough for about 3yrs at their current burn

**Stock’s been a rollercoaster:** up ~188% over the past year but choppy in 2025. Current market cap is ~$6B, which feels pricey for a pre revenue company… but they’ve got big names backing them United Airlines, Stellantis, Palantir, Anduril & are pushing toward FAA certification

**Q3 will be telling:**

- UAE commercial flights (even small revenue proves the model works)

- Manufacturing updates (6 aircraft in production, 3 in final assembly)

- Any defense contract wins

- FAA certification milestones


If they hit these, could be a big runway for growth. If not, might be some turbulence ahead.

Bill ackman is looking to make a 1-3B acquisition and it can be announced soon.

It is expected that an announcement can happen anytime soon/weeks prior to his annual meeting on Sep 30.

the reason why Warren outperforms the market & loves insurance, is because insurers reinvests their profits. For Warren & Geico, they rolled their profits & reinvest into equity, which allows them to make outsized returns. Bill Ackman wants to replicate this success.

  
Based on his vision, a P&C insurer is his most likely choice, as reserve requirements are low which allows for reinvestment and it also follows the Geico playbook pretty well.

LMND mcap is too high, HIPO mcap is too small & unprofitable, ROOT makes sense(1.42B) but management has always mentioned that they wanted to grow ROOT to be larger than PGR, so that is likely out of the pic, as ROOT takes the solo approach.

I do not see Bill investing in health insurance due to his past criticism of UNH. Nor is he investing in life insurance due to the higher reserve requirements. Speciality insurance is also too niched with less TAM. Also many MGA's have terrible balance sheets with negative tangible equity (GSHD, RYAN, TWFG, etc)

Morgan Stanley divides nuclear-exposed stocks into three categories: power generators, uranium miners, and equipment and plant providers. The firm’s three favorite U.S. stocks to play the nuclear theme all fall into the first category: Talen Energy (TLN), Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG), and Vistra (VST). 

What's Driving the 'Nuclear Renaissance'?

“The dual imperatives of decarbonization and energy security, combined with a gradual decline in investor exclusions and more favorable financing conditions, are making the nuclear renaissance a truly global investment theme,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts on Tuesday, 8/12/2025.

Best Home-Buyer Plays in advance of Rate Cuts,1mpk1ds,YungPersian,2025-08-13 23:19:24,7,0.77,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mpk1ds/best_homebuyer_plays_in_advance_of_rate_cuts/,"Before reading further, let me make my strategy clear. I’m fully aware this summer is about to be ROUGH when it comes to home sales. My strategy is to get into housing adjacent stocks (furnitures/appliances/DIY tools) at the housing markets low point [imo for this cycle, it seems like we’re pretty close if not AT the low point this summer]. I want to find a stable player trading at fair value that’s positioned to take on the added demand as mortgage rates start to cut. In that regard I’d expect these stocks to dip Q3 had they not already dipped on lowered guidances going into the summer. 

I’ve included some of my thoughts on players I’ve talked about before (whirlpool and Wayfair), but wanted to hear everyone else’s thoughts on what they think could be solid plays to hop into end of summer/early fall (and to hold for the next few years when mortgage rates inevitably will begin to fall). 


Some of my thoughts: 
Nothing jumps out at me when looking at a lot of other players. Main one was RH given they took a beating when tariffs got announced, but before diving into this one too deeply wanted to hear if this passes a sniff test. 

I’ve made posts previously around Wayfair and Whirlpool as potential plays to get ahead of for rate cuts. Wayfair has been doing quite well imo more due to strategy shifts than anything housing related. Whirlpool is still recovering from a recent drop. 

My concern with Wayfair is valuation. It’s just gotten back to being cash positive this year. But how much MORE do we see this growing? With all of these stocks; I don’t think we’re going to see it hit valuations that it garnered in 2020; it’ll be decades until we see a housing market as crazy as that one which benefited furniture companies like Wayfair. My concern is Wayfair can have a breakout quarter but $70+ a share right now seems pretty steep given where they’re at currently (financially and strategy wise). Curious to hear people’s thoughts on that.

The DOE is opening the door to the market so new ideas, new approaches, and new designs can be built more quickly and efficiently. American innovation is one of our strategic advantages, and the DOE’s selection of a number of projects provides a sweeping injection of urgency to meet the moment and unleash American nuclear innovation.”

These selections reflect growing national momentum behind energy innovation and the role of public-private collaboration in delivering bold solutions to America’s energy needs.",2025-08-13,0.976,Positive,"['DOE', 'DOE', 'CEO', 'DOE', 'DOE', 'DOE']"

$BLSH IPO DD,1mp251l,mariomaario,2025-08-13 11:43:46,42,0.81,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mp251l/blsh_ipo_dd/," Key Financial Metrics
1. Revenue:
   - Trailing 12 Months (ended March 31, 2025): $167 million, as reported in IPO-related filings.
   - Fiscal Year 2024: $250.26 billion, a 114.80% increase from $116.51 billion in the prior year. This figure seems unusually high and may reflect a reporting error or inclusion of trading volume rather than operational revenue. Most sources align with the $167 million figure for recent revenue, suggesting the $250.26 billion may be a typo or misinterpreted data (possibly total trading volume or assets under management). For clarity, the $167 million figure is more consistent across sources.

2. Net Income:
   - Q1 2025 (three months ended March 31, 2025): Net loss of $349 million, compared to a profit of $105 million for the full year of 2024.
   - Q2 2025 (estimated for three months ended June 30, 2025): Net income estimated between $106 million and $109 million, driven largely by favorable changes in the fair value of digital assets rather than operating income.
   - Full Year 2024: Earnings of $78.53 million, a 93.96% decrease from the prior year, indicating volatility in profitability.

3. Assets:
   - Liquid Assets (as of March 31, 2025): Bullish holds over $3 billion in liquid assets, including:
     - 24,000 Bitcoin
     - 12,600 Ether
     - Over $418 million in cash and stablecoins
     - Minor amounts in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols (not material to the total).
   - The significant digital asset holdings expose Bullish to price volatility in cryptocurrencies, which directly impacts its balance sheet.

4. IPO Proceeds and Valuation:
   - IPO Size: Bullish aims to raise up to $990 million by offering 30 million shares at $32–$33 per share (upsized from an initial 20.3 million shares at $28–$31).
   - Valuation: At the top of the price range ($33), Bullish would have a market valuation of approximately $4.82 billion, with a fully diluted market cap of $4.3 billion at the midpoint of the initial range.
   - Use of Proceeds: Intended for general corporate purposes, potential acquisitions, and conversion of a portion of proceeds into U.S.-dollar-denominated stablecoins.

5. Expense Structure:
   - Specific expense breakdowns (e.g., operating expenses, cost of revenue) are not detailed in the provided sources. However, the significant Q1 2025 loss ($349 million) suggests high operational or market-related costs, potentially due to:
     - Infrastructure costs for running a high-volume crypto exchange (e.g., technology, cybersecurity).
     - Regulatory compliance expenses, as Bullish holds licenses from bodies like the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and the German Federal Financial Supervision Authority.
     - Costs associated with CoinDesk operations (media, events, and data services).
   - The shift from a $105 million profit in 2024 to a $349 million loss in Q1 2025 indicates potential exposure to digital asset price fluctuations, as fair value changes significantly impacted Q2 2025 net income.

6. Trading Volume:
   - Bullish Exchange’s total trading volume since launch (2021) exceeded $1.25 trillion as of March 31, 2025. This is not revenue but reflects the platform’s activity level, which drives transaction fees and liquidity services revenue.

Capital Structure
- Shares Offered: 30 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.002 per share, with an additional 4.5 million shares available via an underwriters’ option.
- Pre-IPO Equity:
  - Restricted Stock Units (RSUs): Bullish Global RSUs will convert into 200,046 ordinary shares post-IPO.
  - Stock Options: Bullish Global Options will convert into options to acquire 6,058,701 ordinary shares at a weighted average exercise price of $17.80, subject to vesting conditions.
- Investor Interest: Funds managed by BlackRock and ARK Investment Management have indicated interest in purchasing up to $200 million of shares at the IPO price (33% of the initial offering).

### Financial Analysis
- Revenue Growth: The $167 million revenue figure for the trailing 12 months (ending March 31, 2025) reflects operational scale, but the $250.26 billion reported for 2024 is likely a misinterpretation of trading volume or a reporting error. The lower figure aligns with a crypto exchange’s typical revenue model (transaction fees, liquidity services).
- Profitability Volatility: The swing from a $105 million profit in 2024 to a $349 million loss in Q1 2025, followed by an estimated $106–$109 million profit in Q2 2025, highlights significant earnings volatility, likely due to digital asset price fluctuations.
- Balance Sheet Strength: The $3 billion in liquid assets (Bitcoin, Ether, cash, and stablecoins) provides a strong liquidity buffer but ties financial health to crypto market performance.
- Valuation Concerns: At $4.82 billion, the valuation is lower than the $9 billion targeted in the failed 2021 deal but still considered premium by some analysts compared to peers like Coinbase, especially given recent losses.

### Gaps and Limitations
- Incomplete Expense Data: No detailed breakdown of operating expenses, cost of revenue, or capital expenditures is available in the provided sources. Full financial statements in the SEC Form F-1 (filed August 4, 2025, and amended) would provide more clarity.
- Profitability Drivers: The reliance on fair value changes in digital assets for Q2 2025 net income suggests that operating income may be weaker than reported earnings imply.
- Peer Comparison: Bullish defines its peer set as Coinbase, Kraken, LMAX, Gemini, and itBit, but specific financial comparisons (e.g., revenue multiples, profit margins) are not provided.
- Post-IPO Performance: As BLSH began trading on August 13, 2025, real-time financial updates or post-IPO quarterly results are not yet available in the sources.

### Sources for Further Research
- SEC Filings: Access Bullish’s Form F-1 and amendments on the SEC’s EDGAR database (www.sec.gov) for complete financial statements, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements.
- Company Reports: Check Bullish’s investor relations page (if available post-IPO) for updated financials.
- Market Data: Use platforms like Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, or Bloomberg for real-time stock price and trading volume data.
- Analyst Reports: Renaissance Capital, CoinDesk, or Reuters may provide deeper financial analysis post-IPO.

### Conclusion
Bullish (BLSH) shows significant revenue ($167 million for the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2025) and a robust liquidity position ($3 billion in assets), but its financials reflect volatility, with a $349 million loss in Q1 2025 and an estimated $106–$109 million profit in Q2 2025 driven by digital asset valuations. The $4.82 billion IPO valuation is ambitious, and the lack of detailed expense data limits a full assessment of its cost structure. Investors should review the latest SEC filings for comprehensive financials and monitor post-IPO performance for clearer insights into operational efficiency and profitability. The crypto market’s volatility and regulatory risks remain key considerations.",2025-08-13,0.998,Positive,"['IPO', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'ARK', 'IPO', 'SEC', 'LMAX', 'IPO', 'BLSH', 'IPO', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'EDGAR', 'IPO', 'IPO', 'BLSH', 'IPO', 'SEC', 'IPO']"

Coupled with the fact that global tariff negotiations are still at a very high tariff level, is there a possibility that Trump might require other countries to invest in Intel or mandate that they use a portion of Intel products in exchange for tariff reductions? This seems to fit his usual style.


After all, I feel Intel is the most important flagship for Trump’s manufacturing reshoring efforts, and he might place far more emphasis on it than before.

Now, what does this mean?

Bullish: Fast-track status could bring Sweetwater online years sooner, making it the largest dual-feed uranium facility in the U.S. at a time of high prices and strong demand. Add in UEC’s debt-free balance sheet and ongoing production ramp, and the upside looks huge.

Bearish: Permitting speed isn’t a guarantee delays, technical issues, or a uranium price drop could hit hard, and policy shifts could slow progress despite the fast-track tag.

Best stocks to bet against if you are bearish on AI.,1moen3c,chinawcswing,2025-08-12 17:12:09,20,0.62,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1moen3c/best_stocks_to_bet_against_if_you_are_bearish_on/,"Aside from the obvious ones like NVDA, MSFT, META, which tickers would be suitable for shorting or buying puts on, if you are bearish on AI and believe we are in a bubble akin to the dot-com boom?

I see that there are two general categories companies can be placed into:

1. Those which actually provide some kind of AI infrastructure/software that other companies are using and paying for. NVDA, MSFT, META are the obvious ones. But this would also include companies like INOD which provide data labeling services that MSFT/META/etc pay for; or data center/chip related companies like APLD, NVTS, SITM

2. Companies which are simply ""using"" AI in some capacity, which may be providing actual value or may be just a gimmick to increase their stock price. For example SOUN, BBAI, CRNC, PYH, ICAD, DUOT.

If you wanted to take a conservative bearish position, I think the best way to do it would be to identify those companies in #2 whose core value proposition does not include AI but who are merely claiming to use AI to ride the AI hype train. However this might be hard to do.

A moderate bearish position would be to short/buy puts on all companies in #2.

A true bearish position would be to short all companies in #1.

I would think that the valuation would be worth even more, this is probably just an opening salvo.

Google pays Apple approximately $20 billion per year to remain the default search engine on Apple devices, including the Safari browser on iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Costco’s High PE Ratio and its Growth Potential,1mo0ppc,TheDollarLab,2025-08-12 05:56:23,40,0.86,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mo0ppc/costcos_high_pe_ratio_and_its_growth_potential/,"Costco is one of the best retail businesses in the world with decades of consistent growth.

The stock has been trading at a P/E of around 54 and I wanted to see if the fundamentals justify the current price.

**Earnings growth requirements**

If we assume a fair multiple of 27 (which is what I would pay for an exceptional business like Costco) then EPS would need to grow from the current $17.67 to about $36.67 for the valuation to normalize to the price we would be paying today.

Using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the historical EPS growth rate, the median projection lands at around $36 in about six years. That means that if we were to buy at today's price our P/E should get to 27 (what I considered to be a fair value) in 6 years time, but only if growth continues at its historical pace.

**Shift in operating income**

Ten years ago nearly 70% of Costco’s operating income came from membership fees. Since COVID however merchandise profits have surged and are now close to matching memberships.

This didn’t come from higher margins on products (merchandise costs tracked sales almost perfectly) but from operational leverage (SG&A grew much more slowly than revenue).

While this helped profits, merchandise income is far more volatile than membership fees and could shrink quickly if sales slow or costs rise.

**U.S. market saturation?**

Membership growth has been Costco’s main growth engine (mostly from the U.S).

So I did a rough market sizing on the US:

* U.S. population: \~340M
* Remove those under 16 (\~18% of population) -> \~279M people
* Remove the top 20% high-income and bottom 25% low-income households -> \~153M in the core demographic

With \~62M U.S. cardholders, Costco already has **\~40% penetration** of this target market. That’s high for a paid membership model and I think domestic growth could be limited.

**International expansion challenges**

Management has been expanding abroad but Costco’s large warehouses, bulk-buying, car-dependency model doesn’t fit overseas markets as well as North America.

Asia (China, Japan, South Korea) has shown promise but store counts are still low and expansion is slow. Europe’s growth has been minimal, likely due to cultural shopping habits and urban density.

  
**Conclusion**

I think Costco is an exceptional business but matching its historical growth over the next 5-6 years will be challenging given the US market and international hurdles.

I think I'm selling my shares and I will maybe buy back if the price drops, very curious to know what you think about it",2025-08-12,0.9949,Positive,"['EPS', 'EPS', 'COVID', 'SG', 'US', 'US']"

I kept thinking there might be more upside, even though my analysis suggested it was fairly valued.

"Trump flip-flops on Intel CEO, calls him ‘success’ days after demanding resignation",1mnpmw3,Puginator,2025-08-11 21:22:30,1587,0.98,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mnpmw3/trump_flipflops_on_intel_ceo_calls_him_success/,"President Trump said Monday that he met with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, days after the U.S. leader called on Tan to resign. Intel shares rose 2% in extended trading.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump praised Tan and said Tan and members of the Cabinet would come up with suggestions.

“I met with Mr. Lip-Bu Tan, of Intel, along with Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, and Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent,” Trump wrote. “The meeting was a very interesting one. His success and rise is an amazing story. Mr. Tan and my Cabinet members are going to spend time together, and bring suggestions to me during the next week. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tan has been an Intel director since 2022, and in March he replaced Pat Gelsinger as CEO. Last week Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Tan’s ties to China. Cotton brought up a past criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan had been CEO.

Before that it was Facebook, Netflix… and yeah, people who bought the bottom there made a ton of money.
But honestly? There are way more stories about stocks that broke and never came back. Nobody remembers those  after COVID there were loads of them.
So the question is  how do you even know if it’s a golden opportunity or a business that’s done for good? In a down market, sometimes it’s just a beta thing  a stock with high beta will drop twice as much as the index, and that says nothing about the actual business. In an up market? That’s different. Sometimes it’s a real warning sign.
Example CrowdStrike  anyone with basic IT knowledge knew it wasn’t “game over” for them, just a one-off issue. But with something like UNH, I honestly can’t tell if it’s just a dip or a break that won’t recover.

One more thing  personally I don’t think you can build real wealth by buying “cheap” stocks. Sure, it can work as a small slice of your portfolio, but if it’s your main strateg you’ll probably have a lot of green days in the market while your portfolio stays red.

A White House spokeswoman said, “President Trump has selected the best and brightest individuals to lead the federal government. He will announce the next BLS Commissioner when he has made a decision.” Antoni didn’t return requests for comment.

Nextdoor - NXDR: The Next Local Platform Breakout & Why Reddit Buying it Makes Sense,1mmyick,9on,2025-08-11 00:17:09,0,0.35,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mmyick/nextdoor_nxdr_the_next_local_platform_breakout/,"Nextdoor is a hyperlocal social platform sitting at the intersection of community trust, local commerce, and utility. After years of underperformance, it’s in the middle of a *major product relaunch* that’s already driving better engagement and beating revenue estimates. With a market cap under $1B (\~3× revenue), there are multiple untapped monetization levers, and real strategic appeal to larger players (think Reddit, Facebook Marketplace, even Groupon style business lines). The turnaround is just beginning.

# Quick snapshot

* **Market cap:** \~$0.7–0.8B (smallcap, sub $1B).
* **Recent Q2 2025 revenue:** Nextdoor beat consensus (Q2 revenue ≈$65M) and reported improving engagement metrics. Management relaunched the app in July 2025 (big redesign & product pivot).
* **“The new Nextdoor”** (launched July 2025) focuses on Alerts, News, and Faves (AI recommendations + local publisher content), built to make Nextdoor *useful daily* rather than just a social feed.
* **Revenue (approx):** \~$240–250M (implied by recent results / public data). That puts current market cap at roughly \~3x revenue (very rough math).

# Bull case

1. **Founder/leadership momentum.** Nextdoor just rolled out “the new Nextdoor”, a material redesign that emphasizes *Alerts, News, and Faves* (AI recommendations, safety alerts, local news integration). The company is explicitly trying to move from underused UGC feed to a utility-first hyperlocal product. Q2 2025 showed revenue above Street estimates and management reported user engagement gains. That’s the classic early signal: product changes leading to higher engagement leading to more ad inventory and better local targeting. If the relaunch sustains engagement lifts, top line acceleration could follow.
2. **Hyperlocal moat trust & utility.** Facebook/Reddit are broad; Nextdoor owns neighborhood context (addresses/neighborhood boundaries, local public agencies, homeowners groups) and is integrating local news and authoritative alerts (police, utilities, weather). That makes it sticky for time sensitive local information, something Facebook Marketplace can’t fully replicate in a trust/utility sense.
3. **Multiple, under monetized local monetization levers.**
   * **Local ads** (SMBs, local chains, political/municipal buys).
   * **For sale / classifieds & marketplace** (native commerce, transaction take rates or promoted listings).
   * **Public sector / emergency alert contracts** (municipal subscriptions or paid integrations). The relaunch and better engagement can multiply ARPU without needing a full blown global ad sales machine. Q2 showed revenue growth and the company is still far from saturating local ad dollars.
4. **Low current valuation implies big upside for execution.** At \~$0.7–0.8B market cap on \~$240–250M revenue, Nextdoor trades at low revenue multiples (\~3x). If the product relaunch meaningfully improves revenue growth rate and margin profile, multiples could rerate toward higher comps (local ad / classifieds peers), giving sizable upside.
5. **Strategic optionality / M&A interest is plausible.** A hyperlocal network with community trust and data is interesting to players looking to fill local gaps: Reddit (community + local expansion), local classifieds / commerce players, or even retail/media acquirers. Being small cap makes it an easier acquisition target if the relaunch proves momentum. (I’ll expand on Reddit below.)
6. **Playbook borrowable from Groupon/local deals.** Nextdoor already has ""for sale & free"" and local business relationships. Adding structured local offers, time-limited promos, or merchant subscriptions (Groupon style vouchers, merchant promos, or subscription local deals) is a relatively straightforward product and revenue lift. Groupon’s continued local billings show the market still exists; Nextdoor could capture a portion by adding deals and integrating them into neighborhood flows and “Faves” recommendations.

**Catalysts to watch (bull triggers):**

* Sustained weekly/monthly active user growth and time on app after the relaunch.
* ARPU increase in upcoming quarters (ads + local commerce monetization).
* New paid partnerships with municipalities or publishers that create recurring revenue.

# Why Reddit buying Nextdoor could make sense

* **Why it’s logical:** Reddit wants to deepen “real world” community ties and monetize local advertiser demand; Nextdoor brings verified local neighborhoods, public safety integrations, and local ad inventory. Combining Reddit’s community driven content and ad products with Nextdoor’s local reach creates synergies: better local commerce, events, and localized Reddit communities with verified local utility.
* **Why it might not happen:** Reddit could easily build this themselves and one could argue that the subreddits already achieve the main functionality of Nextdoor without needing a seperate app or community.

# Facebook Marketplace Comparison

* Facebook Marketplace is massive and already accounts for huge listing volume and buyer traffic globally (hundreds of millions of users). Meta can bundle marketplace commerce and ad targeting more cheaply than a small competitor. **But** Marketplace is a horizontal player. Nextdoor’s advantage is *hyperlocal trust, neighborhood boundaries, and municipal/publisher relationships*. If Nextdoor nails utility (alerts, local news, verified neighbor recommendations, Faves), it retains defensibility even in the face of Facebook. Think: users who rely on the app for safety and local official alerts may prefer Nextdoor even if they sell on Marketplace.

# How Nextdoor can easily incorporate Groupon like features

* **Merchant dashboard + deals API:** let local merchants create time limited promos, featured deals in neighborhood feeds, or “welcome offers” for neighbors.
* **Promoted merchant cards:** place deals inside the “Faves” recommendation flow and local alerts.
* **Local vouchers + merchant payout integration:** low friction deals (digital coupons) with a small platform fee or merchant subscription. This is lowlift product work (existing forsale and business listings are already present); the value is in embedding offers where neighbors are already looking for recommendations (Faves) and in alerts. Groupon’s Q2 shows local deal demand still exists; Nextdoor could capture a healthier margin by focusing on repeat neighborhood customers rather than mass discounting.

# Valuation

* Market cap ≈ **$0.7–0.8B** vs LTM revenue ≈ **$240–250M** → **\~3x revenue**. For a small-cap social with improving engagement and multiple monetization levers, that multiple is low compared to growth comps that trade at higher revenue multiples when showing reliable growth and margin expansion. If Nextdoor can shift growth profile to midteens revenue growth and improve margins via ad monetization & local commerce, multiple expansion plus faster top-line could easily produce doubled (or more) share value.

# Bear case

1. **History of low engagement & moderation headaches.** Nextdoor has historically struggled with low daily active usage vs registered users and with content quality / moderation issues (which depress advertiser demand). If relaunch fails to fix these, advertisers may be slow to return.
2. **Burn & structural losses / tight balance sheet.** The company is still losing money (GAAP net losses and sizable stock comp / restructuring historically). If growth proves expensive or ad demand weakens, cash burn could force equity raises that dilute shareholders or constrain investment. Q2 numbers still showed negative adjusted EBITDA (though improved).
3. **Big competitors with scale and marketplace traction.** Meta’s Facebook Marketplace has enormous user reach and listing depth; Meta can bundle marketplace commerce with ad targeting at scale. If Facebook decides to deepen local utility + community features, Nextdoor could be outgunned on commerce. Meta’s massive audience and Marketplace stats show a very large TAM that’s hard for a small player to defend against.
4. **Execution risk on product overhaul.** Relaunches often raise expectations. If adoption is slow, or if new features don’t convert to monetizable usage (or create moderation/legal headaches), investors will punish the stock. The market is already skeptical (shares trade near multiyear lows).
5. **Ad market cyclicality & macro risk.** Local ad spend tends to be more cyclical. A broader ad slowdown or a recession could hit Nextdoor hard given its SMB exposure and lower ad pricing power.

# Bottom line / recommendation

* **Bullish case:** Low current valuation, a major product relaunch with clear utility (alerts/local news/AI recommendations), early signs of engagement/revenue improvement, and many undermonetized local revenue levers (ads, local commerce, municipal partnerships). If the relaunch sustains engagement, upside is meaningful.
* **Bearish case:** Execution risk, historical moderation/engagement problems, ongoing losses and potential dilution, and big competitors (Meta’s Marketplace) that can replicate commerce features.",2025-08-11,0.9957,Positive,"['AI', 'AI', 'UGC', 'ARPU', 'ARPU', 'API', 'LTM', 'GAAP', 'TAM', 'SMB', 'AI']"

CENTENE (CNC) is a good long term opportunity at this level,1mmwihz,PleasantAnomaly,2025-08-10 22:45:51,20,0.72,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mmwihz/centene_cnc_is_a_good_long_term_opportunity_at/,"Like every self-respecting Value investor, I've been looking for opportunities to divest from my tech-heavy portfolio. AI Stocks like NVDA, PLTR, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA have done great, but some of these valuations just don't make sense and I don't think now is a good time to buy into them anymore.

That brings me to look for other opportunities. I don't think there's a better opportunity right now than the Healthcare sector.

Historically, Healthcare has outperformed the S&P, thanks to relatively stable stocks like CNC.

Let's take a step back. What the f\*%# happened to this stock in the past 2 months ?

They came out and :

1. Said that their Medical Loss Ratio(MLR) will be much higher because claims are getting expensive
2. Pulled guidance for 2025

Since then, they've had their Q2 Earnings call. They've revised guidance to a EPS of 1.75 for 2025 (from 7.5 previously, ouch). Given that their Q1 2025 EPS was 2.9, and their Q2 EPS was -0.16, this is pricing in a combined -1$ EPS for Q3 and Q4.

The bar is very low. Even a small sign of life from the CEO, could send this stock easily back to the 40 - 50 range, as a path to profitability is starting to be priced into the stock.

The recent headwind, albeit very impactful in the short to medium-term, is temporary. the CEO has said that they have already completed rate re-filings in the 29 states by now, and that the rate decision for each states will be expected in September. The new rates that determine the amount of premiums received, will take into account the high cost for behavioral health(therapists, psychiatric meds etc...),  home health services, and expensive drugs (Wegovy, Ozempic...) .

Compared to the giant UNH, CNC has a much better reputation, isn't under DOJ Investigation, and Ambetter, their Health Insurance Marketplace, has a claims denial rate of 14%, more than half that of UNH.

# Path back to profitability :

CEO and the team are now laser focused on restoring profitability by pulling the necessary levers :

\- identifying and reducing areas where claims have been too ""costly""

\- increasing premium rates, to account for the challenging environment, and with a worst case scenario in mind (continued high morbidity and utilization rate)

\- hinting at a stock buyback in the Earnings call

\- Immune from tariff BS and TACO

# Possible risks

\- The trend of high morbidity and drug use continues to escalate, leading to more people needing expensive surgeries and drugs ==> unlikely, as people who fear that their benefits are being taken away with OBBBA, have already stocked up on drugs/done surgeries

\- continued political pressure on healthcare costs with bills like the OBBBA ==> unlikely, as this bill seems to be a one-and-done on healthcare, and now the Administration will focus on other more pressing matters (Russia - Ukraine conflict, Inflation, crypto, tax bills for the rich etc ...).

Also, this is speculation, but I think the full impact of the OBBBA are wayyy overstated. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2034, 16 million people will lose coverage, but that's a decade away. This will be accounted for in the rate re-pricing.

\- Risks of people changing Insurers because of higher rates ==> given that every Health insurer will be increasing rates, among them: Elevance, UNH, Molina, Blue Cross Blue Shield, CNC will be no exception. People won't switch because none of the other options are better. Centene's health plan is pretty competitive, and compared to Molina health who's the most affordable, Centene's has much better coverage(available across 29 states vs 8 for Molina)

Overall, I think this is a compelling buy, not just for CNC, but for the Health care sector overall, as the benefits greatly outweigh the risk at this point.

I’m 23, living in France, and about to receive my first salary from a 6-month internship.
My goal is to start investing as early as possible to build a diversified portfolio over the long term (7–8 years minimum, possibly longer).

At first, my monthly budget for investing will be quite small (low hundreds of euros), but I want to be consistent and progressive.
I’m not looking for short-term gains my priority is steady growth, risk management, and diversification.

My idea is to include:
	•	Stocks/ETFs 
	•	Real estate (REITs SCPI OPCI )
	•	A small portion of crypto , gold ..

	1.	How would you allocate small amounts at the beginning?
	2.	Which platforms or brokers would you recommend for someone in France/Europe?
	3.	Any tips on balancing diversification with small monthly contributions?
	4.	What are the common mistakes new investors make that I should avoid?

India may slap tariff countermeasures on select American commodities, a retaliation to Washington’s move to impose a steep 50% duty in June on steel, aluminium and their derivatives from India, people aware of the matter have said.

To be sure, the levies on steel and aluminium have played out as a parallel trade dispute at the World Trade Organization, but its timing would make it the first Indian retaliation since Trump’s July 31 announcement of the 25% tariff on all Indian goods entering the US when trade talks failed to reach a breakthrough and his subsequent penalties over Russian oil purchases announced on August 6.

According to people aware of the matter, India has prepared legal grounds for the retaliatory action on steel and aluminium under World Trade Organization rules after the US rejected New Delhi’s request for consultations over what India considers WTO-non-compliant safeguard measures disguised as national security actions. “Washington is unwilling to address New Delhi’s concerns through talks, which leaves India with little option other than to retaliate,” one person said.

PagerDuty (PD) high chance of buyout potential ?,1mm6ofv,abnormalpersona,2025-08-10 02:08:08,7,0.65,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mm6ofv/pagerduty_pd_high_chance_of_buyout_potential/,"Shares of PagerDuty popped from $14.71 to a high of $18.00 July 28 when Reuters came out with an https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/pagerduty-exploring-potential-sale-after-receiving-buyer-interest-sources-say-2025-07-25/ that they are ""working with Qatalyst Partners on the sale effort, after attracting interest from both financial sponsors and strategic acquirers.""

TD upgraded PagerDuty to Buy on high likelihood of buyout with a price target of $22 up from $17. They mentioned Qatalyst has a strong track of software deals and many similar situations have resulted in sales over the years, the analyst tells investors in a research note. TD sees a range of $19 to $24.50 per share in a potential buyout and finds the stock’s risk/reward “compelling” at current levels.

PagerDuty is currently sitting at $15.46 with a market cap of less than 1.5B. As someone who is a software engineer at fortune 500 company I can easily see Saas companies such as ServiceNow, Splunk (now part of Cisco), Datadog or even Salesforce integrating their product offerings with PagerDuty. 

One thing I like is that Qatalyst Partners the rumored company they are now working with already has pending closing deals with ServiceNow! https://qatalyst.com/deals/ As you can see Moveworks is pending to be acquired by NOW for 2.85 Billion so it won't be shocking to see NOW go on a shopping spree with PD too. Qatalyst Partners also closed deals for Splunk integrating with Cisco which I think is a company that can afford to buy PD

What do you guys think ? From current price it is a 20-40%  price jump. All companies who has worked with Qatalyst Partners were sold at around more than 30% premiums prior to announcement of sale.

Wells Fargo analyst gives TECK $101 price target (It's currently $33.),1mlwaq9,MarshallGrover,2025-08-09 18:17:48,63,0.76,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mlwaq9/wells_fargo_analyst_gives_teck_101_price_target/,"Relevant link: [https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/teck-resources-stock-rating-reiterated-at-**overweight-by-wells-fargo-93CH-4179952**](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/teck-resources-stock-rating-reiterated-at-overweight-by-wells-fargo-93CH-4179952)

**Full disclosure:** I'm a longstanding TECK holder. It's a large part of my port, I recently added some, and I plan to hold it for many years to come. As such, I'm biased and have a lot to gain by seeing it moon.

On the other hand, I think I'm pretty realistic. I have a decent grasp of the challenges TECK is facing and the lack of excitement about mining stocks in general these days. Concerning the latter, capital tends to flow where it can grow fastest, and mining isn't usually the place do to that. Still, I thought I'd bring this recent news to your attention and see what your thoughts are...

**The Bull Case (""You've got to have Fauth"")**  
On August 8, 2025, Wells Fargo analyst Tiago Fauth reiterated his Overweight rating of TECK with a **$101 price target** ([Source](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/teck-resources-stock-rating-reiterated-at-overweight-by-wells-fargo-93CH-4179952)). TECK closed at $33.03 on that same day. That's a 206% upside. Fauth calls TECK ""one of the most attractive risk/rewards"" in their coverage, arguing the market's skepticism isn't justified. His confidence seems rooted in:

1. **QB2's Potential:** A belief that once fully operational, this massive copper mine in Chile (which Teck has a 60% stake in) will be a major cash flow machine.
2. **Undervaluation:** Seeing TECK trading at a steep discount to peers, which should narrow as QB2 finally ramps up.
3. **Solid Fundamentals:** Noting Teck's strong liquidity (current ratio of 3.47x).

**The Counterweight (""Reality Check"")**  
While I admit that $101 is an exciting number (even if it strikes me as a bit odd) the stock's current price near $33 (down 39% from its 52-week high) and recent analyst moves tell a different story. Here's where my own caution comes in:

1. **QB2 remains the core challenge:** This project has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and most recently, issues with the tailings management plant and shiploader. In the second quarter, results of which were reported on July 24, copper sales missed expectations, adjusted EBITDA came in slightly below estimates and, critically, Teck had to lower its 2025 production guidance because of ongoing QB2 ramp-up difficultes (e,g, tailings, shiploader). Thus, Fauth's these majorly hinges on QB2 finally hitting its stride smoothly and soon.
2. **Fauth's view is an outlier:** The consensus analyst price target sits between $43 and $44, depending on the source. And recent analyst actions have been cautious:
   * JPMorgan downgraded TECK from Overweight to Neutral.
   * B.Riley moved from Buy to Neutral and cut its target.
   * Benchmark, Jefferies, and Raymond James all reduced their targets (though some kept Buy ratings). The common thread? Concerns about QB2's timeline, execution risks and the impact on near-term performance.
3. **Macro Headwinds Persist:** China's struggling property sector (a huge copper consumer) continues to weigh on demand sentiment. Global growth remains uncertain and copper prices are inherently volatile.

**My Take as a Shareholder:**  
I own TECK because I believe in the long-term copper story (though it does tend to get overhyped at times), and QB2's *potential*. While I can't say I have as much faith as Fauth --a $101 price target seems a bit of a stretch-- it does illustrate how big the upside *could* be if a lot things go perfectly right. As I said at the start of this post, I'm in it for the long term. Very long. Until we see consistent, positive operational progress on QB2, however, I expect it to trade near where it's at, which may prove to big a big buying opportunity...or not.

**What are your thoughts?** Is Wells Fargo seeing something fundamental that the rest of the market (and other analysts) is missing? Or does the $101 target seem disconnected from Teck's current operational reality? Is mining --not BItcoin, but actual rocks from the ground-- something you even consider investing in? I'm keen to hear different perspectives.

I was DCAing about 5k per month and had hit about 50k before the market crashed in April. Unfortunately, I did not have a lot of cash on the sidelines and I wanted to build an emergency fund, so I did just that. I saved 15k, but I missed out on a lot of opportunities in the market. I did have a chance to buy Google, Amazon and VOO when the market was low, but not much (only 2500 of each). I have since added about another 5k of Google, 1k of Amazon, and 2.5k of UNH. I am only up 10% since November. I  feel bad seeing many people up 30% to 70% year to date, while I have nowhere near those returns. Unfortunately I did not have the cash ready to invest when the market was down, and chose to build an emergency fund instead. I also started a position in PLTR in November at $58 before buying VOO, but did not trust it and sold out due to fear of the unknown. As we all know now, that was a huge mistake. I am now focused on buying individual stocks, and will not make the same mistake of lump summing money into an ETF. What are some mistakes that you have made in the market?

Cramer said ""amazing digital advertising business because it’s basically the last bastion of the old school internet""  WTF?  That makes no sense to me. What am I missing?

EDIT:  To respond to some of the resultant conjecture below:   
1 AI says ""*Reddit’s dominant income source continues to be advertising—ranging from* ***84% to nearly 98%****, depending on the period and granularity observed. Revenue from data licensing (i.e., “selling data” to AI firms) remains relatively minor, generally in the* ***low single-digit to low double-digit percent*** *range of total revenue.*""  
2 Its super high PE indicates high expectations -- PE is not proof of an eventual outcome. The dotcom bubble was riddled with high PEs.  
3 This 'great company' as someone commented, and a great deal of its userbase constitute a cesspool. From a returned-CEO caught rigging interactions to ""communities"" openly flowing with hate for others, it can never provide paying advertisers the return they now think they're getting-- any more than NXDR did. It has the same web of fifedoms where humans inevitably run their community in variant and non contrubitive ways. Its Q424 news letter is full of unprovable and exaggerated puffery to keep the mirage (to advertisers) going; I'm calling BS on their DAUq tallies. This mirage can't last. META towers over RDDT because, though it has groups, META is user-centric and therefore localized fiefdoms can't trod on META users like they do in RDDT and NXDR. The truth always eventually comes out and so advertisers will some day learn this. If you want to argue this, take a look at Bytedance's TikTok and answer for yourself why it will never be publicly traded.

The surge brings year-to-date net inflows to $672.8 billion, translating to an average of $96 billion per month. At that pace, 2025 is on track to mark a second consecutive year of $1 trillion-plus inflows.

U.S. equity ETFs led the way in July with $52 billion in net inflows, buoyed by continued strength in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100. Both indexes rallied to record highs during the month, driven by the ongoing boom in AI-related tech stocks.

International equity ETFs followed with $26.2 billion in inflows, while U.S. fixed-income ETFs brought in $18.3 billion. Currency ETFs also posted a strong month, gathering $11.9 billion as investors sought exposure to cryptocurrencies.

**VOO Leads ETF Inflows**

Among individual funds, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) topped the list with $12.5 billion of inflows in July. It has now collected $72.6 billion in 2025 alone, far ahead of any other ETF and on pace for another $100 billion-plus year. 

In second place for the month was the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which pulled in $5.3 billion. With Bitcoin prices hitting record highs above $120,000 in July, the fund’s year-to-date inflows have reached $20.3 billion. 

The iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) also saw a notable pickup, attracting $4.2 billion during the month and bringing its 2025 total to $6.2 billion. Ether prices soared in July on the back of strong ETF demand and growing interest in stablecoin infrastructure and Ether-based corporate treasury strategies.

Other ETFs drawing significant inflows in July included the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF), the Simplify Government Money Market ETF (SBIL) and the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV).

Tesla Robotaxi scores permit to run ride-hailing service in Texas,1mlb2hg,Puginator,2025-08-08 23:57:59,0,0.48,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mlb2hg/tesla_robotaxi_scores_permit_to_run_ridehailing/,"Tesla has been granted a permit to run a ride-hailing business in Texas, allowing the electric vehicle maker to compete against companies including Uber and Lyft.

Tesla Robotaxi LLC is licensed to operate a “transportation network company” until August 6, 2026, according to a listing on the website of the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, or TDLR. The permit was issued this week.

Elon Musk’s EV company has been running a limited ride-hailing service for invited riders in Austin since late June. The select few passengers have mostly been social media influencers and analysts, including many who generate income by posting Tesla fan content on platforms like X and YouTube.

The Austin fleet consists of Model Y vehicles equipped with Tesla’s latest partially automated driving systems. The company has been operating the cars with a valet, or human safety supervisor in the front passenger seat tasked with intervening if there are issues with the ride. The vehicles are also remotely supervised by employees in an operations center.

Musk, who has characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic,” said on Tesla’s earnings call last month that he believes Tesla could serve half of the U.S. population by the end of 2025 with autonomous ride-hailing services.

The Texas permit is the first to enable Tesla to run a “transportation network company.” TDLR said Friday that this kind of permit lets Tesla operate a ride-hailing business anywhere in the state, including with “automated motor vehicles,” and doesn’t require Tesla to keep a human safety driver or valet on board.

Crowdstrike Is A Better Investment than Palo Alto Networks,1ml54v6,Fountainheadusa,2025-08-08 19:49:16,2,0.52,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ml54v6/crowdstrike_is_a_better_investment_than_palo_alto/,"**Crowdstrike (CRWD) $422 Palo Alto Networks, (PANW) $168**

Given how well other cybersecurity companies have done, PANW has been an under performer, gaining just 10% in the past year, but with a stellar record of a 286% gain in 5, and 481% in 10 years. 

Currently, the stock remains subdued with the acquisition of CyberArk, and unless there are other catalysts announced on earnings date 8/18, it could remain subdued for a while.

The CyberArk acquisition for a $25 billion valuation, hasn’t been well received by the markets, with a significant drop in PANW's stock price from $203 to $168. 

**Why did they buy it?** To fill an identity management product gap, and increase its addressable market, but it it doesn't add significantly to a $9Bn company, and recouping that $25Bn will take several years.

Palo Alto is aggressively pursuing “platformization”. The “platformization” goal and zeal to achieve it becomes very critical for larger or mid size security firms, because of Crowdstrike’s (CRWD) success as a one stop shop. 

Crowdstrike with almost $5Bn in revenues is one of the largest companies in the sector with 23% revenue growth and a massive market cap of $113Bn , or a sales multiple of 18x - the same market cap as the much bigger PANW.

CRWD’s multiple, though expensive, does deserve the premium, because it is also extremely profitable with 27% adjusted operating profit margins, 35% cash flow margins and is also growing revenues faster at 23%. Comparatively PANW's adjusted operating profits are solid at 20% of revenue and cash flow at 25%, but as the larger $9Bn company its sales growth is only 14% valued at a smaller multiple of 12.

Palo in its zeal to achieve the same crown/halo has probably overpaid for Cyber and is paying the price, but it needed CyberArk for itsAI-driven identity management capabilities, to remain competitive.

I own Crowdstrike, but I don't have enough compelling reasons to buy Palo Alto, even though the discounted price looks attractive, I would prefer to wait to see if there’s anything better on earnings day.

You don’t own enough Google- Another “Google is undervalued” post,1mkzgmj,brett_baty_is_him,2025-08-08 16:12:59,875,0.88,402,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mkzgmj/you_dont_own_enough_google_another_google_is/,"OpenAI just released their frontier model and suffice to say… it flopped. 

People are waiting with bated breath to see what Google has cooked up. They already released Genie 3, which nobody is even close to yet on world models. I think it will be trivial for them to surpass or at least catch up to OpenAI on the intelligence front for frontier LMM. And they have always been better than other AI companies from a context length and cost perspective. 

Just from an AI front, Google is killing it. Their narrow AI is winning Nobel prizes with Alphafold. Discovering algorithms with AlphaEvolve. Advancing robotics. 

Even if you don’t think Google will win the AI race to general intelligence or don’t even believe anyone will get there (which is the long term “this stock will absolutely explode if they hit AGI” bet):


let’s just look at valuations:

If OpenAI is valued at $500b then Deepmind is easily $500b. 

If Netflix is $500b then Youtube is easily $700b. 

Search is easily $1-2T. 

Now we are sitting around Googles current $2.5T valuation. 

But there’s more! 

How much is Google Cloud worth? Easily $300+ billion just based on current revenue. 

This is part of cloud but how much is their tensor chip tech alone worth? AI specific compute that’s competitive to Nvidia? Short answer is: a lot. 

If Tesla is worth $1T partly off self driving car hype, how much is Waymo worth? Easily $100-200b. 

How much is the Android/Google Play business worth? 

How much is every app that we all use daily worth? (Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc)


I know this has been said before but Google is literally a competitor to every single major Tech companies business. They have their hands in every single pot. Whilst, they have historically had issues with marketing and selling their product, their product suite *is good*. They don’t just have a useless competitor like bing is to their search, they actually put up real competition like Google Docs is to Word. 

People talk about the risk of Google getting broken up but that might be the best thing for investors. The individual parts of Google are so valuable that forcing the market to value them separately might actually unlock value. It wouldn’t be crazy if a breakup made investors richer, not poorer (at least in the short term). The market would finally have to pull its head out of its ass and price these pieces properly.

"ZETA just dropped a 70% FCF surge, margin expansion, and a platform play that’s actually working, why isn’t anyone talking about this",1mksi8a,Brilliant_Builder697,2025-08-08 11:20:37,0,0.32,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mksi8a/zeta_just_dropped_a_70_fcf_surge_margin_expansion/,"  
**TL;DR: They’re scaling efficiently, FCF is surging, margins are tightening, and the platform play is working. Not many SaaS names are executing like this right now.**

Edit: changed the fcf and ebitda figures so that they are all on the same period basis

  
Zeta just posted one of its strongest quarters yet, and the numbers across the board are showing exactly what you want from a scaling SaaS name.

**Revenue came in at $308M, up 35% YoY** Growth was powered by deeper OneZeta adoption (multi-use case usage ramping), big wins in both enterprise and agency channels, and solid ARPU uplift from AI-driven tools like Zeta Answers.

**Gross margin expanded 210bps to 62.1%**, mostly thanks to a cleaner revenue mix, 75% of revenue now comes from direct channels (vs. 67% last year). That’s huge for platform-level efficiency. The more products clients adopt, the better the margins.

On the cost side, **G&A was up 21%** (below revenue growth), showing operational leverage even as they scale AI infra and leadership. **R&D jumped 31%**, but that’s a good thing, it reflects sustained investment in AI innovation like Agent Studio and CDP integration. Meanwhile, **S&M rose just 14%**, so they’re clearly getting more out of the sales team with less spend.

**Operating margin improved by 10pts** (still slightly negative at -1.7%), and **profit margin came in at -4.2%**, up 8pts YoY. Not profitable yet, but they’re closing in fast.

**Free cash flow was the standout: $33.6M this quarter**, driven by massive improvements in op cash and tight capex.

**Adj. EBITDA hit $59M** thanks to higher direct usage and more clients running multiple use cases. Agencies moving to direct is a structural win here.

**Balance sheet’s in good shape**: cash is flat at $365M, but total current assets are up slightly. **Debt-to-assets improved to 38.8%**, so they’ve still got flexibility to invest in growth without stretching the balance sheet.

Going forward I would validate the investment potential by looking at:

i) Direct mix in revenue. Rising direct mix signals successful migration of agency holdco clients and independents. It will also lead to better unit economics, margin expansion, and stronger FCF.

On another note, the technical picture seems undecided, but I would argue that the key level to clear is $19.74. If it punches through that on volume, bulls are back in business. If not? Could be a fakeout and we head back into the old range. Tread carefully here. Looks bullish, but not bulletproof.

Novo Nordisk is a top pick - Winner in Obesity treatment market,1mks1ey,Napoleon_Bongaparte,2025-08-08 10:55:40,76,0.73,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mks1ey/novo_nordisk_is_a_top_pick_winner_in_obesity/,"Hello Guys,

as a european investor I am surprised by the huge crash the Novo Nordisk shares had to go through and now is the time to buy the huge dip.

For a long time Novo Nordisk was the most valuable company in Europe, but due to their not excellent Q2 2025 numbers and competition in the obesity treatment market they suffered a huge crash. Their market cap declined by \~80 billion $ from june to today. The stocks are trading at a historical 4 year low with a P/E ratio of only \~12 despite their great position in the huge obesity treatment market.

Yesterday their main competitor Eli Lilly released a study about their new pill for obesity treatment which is a lot worse than the pill from Novo Nordisk. Eli Lilly lost \~16%, (\~75 billion $). I think the money will go to Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk plans to achieve FDA approval for their pill by the end of this year and will therefore have the best product available in the market. 

Novo has been on a 2 day course rallye gaining \~11% but it's still very cheap compared to June or the past years. I think the money from Eli Lilly will be invested in Novo Nordisk and because it will have the best product as soon as the end of the year it will be the market leader in obesity treatment.

I think Novo shares can reach their all time highs again, therefore an increase of \~200% is realistic in maybe 1-2 Years.

I am looking forward to your opininons on Novo.",2025-08-08,0.8723,Positive,['FDA']

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

What the analysts got wrong about Eli Lilly's oral GLP...,1mkka69,Lunar_Excursion,2025-08-08 03:13:07,79,0.83,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mkka69/what_the_analysts_got_wrong_about_eli_lillys_oral/,"So LLY just got rekt today because their oral GLP showed lower than expected % body weight loss of 12%... Lilly says that the results are actually as good as you're gonna get in an oral GLP... so why is there a difference of expectation?

DOSING....

It's well known that GLP drugs have a dose dependent efficacy AND adverse effect profile... simply put, the higher the dose the better the performance but also higher the chance of side effects (up to a point of course)...

So what are the numbers?

Wegovy 2.4mg is about 15% body weight loss... Zepbound 15mg is about 20%... and LLY's Phase III drug Retatrutide (the Triple G Agonist) 12mg is around 25%....

How about oral GLPs?

Semaglutide 50mg is 15% (OASIS-1).... BUT 25mg is 13% (OASIS-4)!!!!!!! and which dose did NVO apply for FDA approval? you guessed it, 25mg....

So how does this relate to LLY's Orforglipron?

Well in their Phase II trial, Orforglipron was trialed up to a dose of 45mg. That dose had a 14% body weight reduction at 36 weeks (and FYI the 36mg dose had a 13% reduction in that trial)... BUT LLY decided (just like NVO did) to take the most balanced dose to Phase III: Orforglipron 36mg (25mg for Semaglutide)...

So what's going on here is that analysts are comparing Orforglipron 36mg to Semaglutide 50mg, which NVO isn't even applying for FDA approval... Of note is that both Orforglipron 45mg and Semaglutide 50mg can actually match Wegovy 2.4mg in % body weight loss. However the high doses necessary to match that performance likely increases the adverse effect incidence and that makes them less attractive.

I loaded the boat on LLY today, maybe this info can assuage some LLY bagholders here...",2025-08-08,0.9574,Positive,"['LLY', 'GLP', 'GLP', 'GLP', 'AND', 'LLY', 'III', 'OASIS', 'BUT', 'OASIS', 'NVO', 'FDA', 'LLY', 'II', 'FYI', 'BUT', 'LLY', 'NVO', 'III', 'NVO', 'FDA', 'LLY', 'LLY']"

The social media company said it had 578 million global monthly active users in the second quarter, ahead of the 574.5 million that StreetAccount was projecting. Pinterest said in May that it had 570 million monthly active users in the first quarter.

Pinterest recorded $251 million in second quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBIDTA, which was higher than StreetAccount’s estimates of $233 million.

“We delivered another strong quarter, reinforcing the essential role we play in helping families save time, money, and effort putting food on the table,” wrote outgoing CEO Fidji Simo in a shareholder letter to employees.

Simo, who helped take the grocery delivery company public in 2023 and guided it through a massive growth period during the Covid-19 pandemic, will step down from her position later this month as she joins OpenAI as its new head of applications.

Simo will remain head of the board as business chief Chris Rogers steps into the role. Rogers, who joined the company in 2019, was appointed CEO in May.

Gross transaction value, a metric that tracks the value of goods sold, rose about 11% from a year ago to $9.08 billion and surpassed a FactSet estimate of $8.93 billion. Net income more than doubled from a year ago to $116 million, or 41 cents per share.

Instacart said it expects gross transaction value to range between $9 billion and $9.15 billion for the current quarter, surpassing the $8.93 billion analysts had forecast.

Orders rose 17% to $82.7 million from a year ago. Instacart said its average value per order fell 5% due in part to a lower free delivery threshold for Instacart+ members.

Shares have jumped 17% year to date.

So...

A couple years in playing on RH with a pretty small amount total, I feel pretty ok about figuring out what I want to buy and why, and how much, etc (sort of, ha).

I just can't figure out when to sell... 

I have a hard time when something is doing well, and the analysis is saying everywhere ""buy"" or even ""hold"" to sell it, even if I'm ""supposed to"" per rules I've seen around. 

For example, I've got a small amount (100 shares) of a stock that I've had for about 4 years that's gone up over 500%. But it keeps going up, and analysts say it's a stock to buy, even at current price. 

Do I sell enough to cover initial investment, even though it's a small enough amount that I don't mind losing it? Do I sell it all because 500% is a fucking amazing return, whatever it may eventually go to? Do I hold it all and see where to can go?

I tend towards the latter, but that's probably emotional investing, right?

Just trying to figure out how to do this the best way, any help appreciated. Thank you",2025-08-07,0.9884,Positive,['RH']

Uber, which offers robotaxis from Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab-owned Waymo, has been strengthening its foothold in the self-driving taxi industry through partnerships with automakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG.DE), opens new tab and Lucid (LCID.O), opens new tab, just as Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab seeks to expand its fledgling robotaxi business.

Khosrowshahi on Wednesday pitched the tie-ups as part of a larger plan that involves three robotaxi business models: paying partners that own such vehicles a fixed rate, sharing revenue with fleet operators and owning vehicles while licensing software for self-driving technology.


""We are talking to private equity players, we have talked to banks,"" the CEO said. ""Once we prove the revenue model, how much these cars can generate on a per day basis, there will be plenty of financing to go around.""
For now, Uber said it was planning on using a ""modest"" portion of its around $7 billion in annual cash flows to fund deployments. It might also sell minority stakes in companies to aid the expansion, it said.


Analysts have said that mass robotaxi deployment could lower driver-reliant Uber's operating costs and boost profitability.
The company has been offering Waymo robotaxis on its ride-hailing app in Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. In April, Uber entered a deal with Volkswagen for thousands of autonomous electric vans in the United States over the next decade.

Can the Firefly IPO... Fly? (DD on $FLY),1mk0xc0,WinningWatchlist,2025-08-07 14:02:18,14,0.66,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mk0xc0/can_the_firefly_ipo_fly_dd_on_fly/,"# I love IPOs!!!!!!!!!!

The last IPO I thought was amazing was Figma [(it's been a week lol).](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ma8fm5/figuring_out_the_figma_ipo_dd_on_fig/) Firefly is opening today and there is, to put it lightly, hype.

**Can Firefly Fly? You would not believe your eyes, etc etc.**

Firefly Aerospace Inc. is a Texas-based space and defense technology founded in 2017 that provides ""end-to-end mission solutions for government and commercial clients"". They **design, manufacture, and operate** their own rockets and spacecraft with vertically integrated production facilities.

Firefly’s business has two main segments: Launch Services (delivering satellites and payloads to orbit) and Spacecraft Solutions (building vehicles like lunar landers and orbital transfer tugs). Its flagship Alpha rocket [(Link to one of their rockets) ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_Alpha)is a small-lift launcher (\~2K lbs to low Earth orbit) that first reached orbit in 2022 and has since completed four orbital missions. On the spacecraft side, the Blue Ghost lander landed on the Moon landing in March 2025, and are developing Elytra orbital vehicles for satellite deployment and lunar data relay services. Firefly positions itself as a one-stop shop for space missions, combining launch vehicles, lunar landers, and in-orbit services to meet demand from national security and commercial customers seeking rapid access to space. Looking ahead, Firefly is expanding into medium-lift launch with Eclipse**,** a larger, partially reusable rocket co-developed with Northrop Grumman.

**FireFly Financials (Lighting cash on fire, in addition to flies)**

Firefly is **unprofitable due to heavily investing in R&D/production. This is expected for a company that require massive upfront capital and long development cycles before achieving commercial scale**. Doubly so for spaceflight companies. 

# Metrics (USD Millions)

|Metric|FY 2023|FY 2024|Q1 2024|Q1 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|$55.2|$60.8|$8.3|$55.9|
|**Gross Profit**|$26.6|–$11.4|–$1.9|$2.2|
|**Gross Margin**|48.2%|–18.7%|–23.1%|4.0%|
|**Operating Income**|–$131.9|–$209.5|–$49.1|–$58.5|
|**Net Income**|–$135.5|–$231.1|–$52.8|–$60.1|

**Note: There is no information from 2022, the financial information in this S-1 is notably sparse.** 

The company’s **net losses are deepening**. Firefly reported a **$231.1 million net loss in 2024,** mainly due to heavy spending on development. R&D expense alone was $149.5 million in 2024! In Q1 2025, Firefly lost another $60.1 million despite the revenue jump. 

**Firefly acknowledges that it** **does not expect to be profitable for several years as it scales production and develops new vehicles.**

As of March 31, 2025, the company had **$176.9 million in cash** on hand, but also carried **$147.7 million in debt**. The IPO proceeds (targeting \~$600+ million) are thus crucial to replenish cash. Ironically, this is what IPOs are meant for- securing more cash in order to stay alive (in addition to gaining liquidity for their shares). Gross margin was negative in 2024 (119% of revenue), and operating/net margins are negative as well. Firefly NEEDS massive revenue scaling and more launches to absorb the MASSIVE (low-taper fade) cost base they've spent. 

On the flip side, demand is very, very high. FireFly reported a $1.1B backlog as of their S-1 filing, nearly double what they had end of 2023, and have contracts with the US government and defense primes (companies with direct links to the government like LMT/BA/NOC).

Something interesting I read in the S1 was that that 95% of the 2024 revenue came from three customers- (speculated to be NASA, USAF, and someone unknown) so revenue is lumpy, as it usually is with these contract based companies). 

**Shareholders/Funding History**

The company’s largest shareholder is AE Industrial Partners (AEI), a aerospace-focused private equity firm. AEI made its initial investment in Firefly in 2022 to acquire a controlling stake from the prior owner and will own \~42% of the company, and control >50% of voting power post-IPO. Firefly’s current Chairman, Kirk Konert, is a partner at AEI, and AEI led multiple funding rounds. For all intents and purposes, I consider AEI to own Firefly. 

Aside from AEI, key investors include strategic partners and venture firms like Northrop Grumman and Astera Institute, a nonprofit/VC entity, which owns about 10% pre-IPO. Tom Markusic, Firefly’s co-founder and former CEO, owns roughly 9-10% stake pre-IPO. There's a lot more I can go into but there IS a decent amount of demand for these shares, and the current cap table is dominated by AEI, Northrop, Astera, and management. **No existing stockholders are selling in the IPO (based on the S1), so this isn't a quick dump on retail from shareholders.** 

**Risks** 

**Firefly has never been profitable and has stated it expects to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. It is entirely reliant on external funding, and looking at their financials, it looks completely possible they will dilute shareholders further within a year of IPOing.** 

Rockets themselves are risky, they can experience launch failures, delays, explosions, same stuff that we've seen with SpaceX rockets. If you need a reference point look up what happened when other spaceflight companies couldn't get their launches on time, the stock would tank. Tariffs are also likely to affect this company materially, and the space market is cutthroat and Firefly is late to the party. In launch services, SpaceX, are already the major players Rocket Lab. In lunar landers, it has to compete with LUNR and other private companies developing the same. 

As noted before, revenue is highly tied to government contracts and a few key customers (US governmental agencies and defense contractors). If we ever have a president that likes to change his mind a lot, this could be a serious problem. Regulations can also hinder Firefly's business operations (FAA launch licenses, export controls, FCC licenses, environmental studies (pretty sure SpaceX ignores these lol), and can hinder/suspend operations. 

**TL;DR** Firefly is pretty much a typical risky space startup- there's execution risk, market risk, geopolitical risk, political risk, technical risk, funding/financial risk, competitor risk, ownership risk, rocketships blowing up risk. The company isn't profitable, will likely dilute their shareholders and is owned by a PE firm (which is not a great sign). It DOES have technology that performs (they can actually land on the moon) and a decently sized backlog, but the financials are disastrous and the IPO valuation is currently at 90x 2024 sales. 

Thinking back on my Figma DD, I liked Figma because literally any UX developer could tell you how useful Figma was to their job and how it dominates the industry, but FLY seems like a small puppy owned by a puppy mill breeder (AEI) dropped off into a den of feral pitbulls. The ownership by AEI is a huge concern of mine and essentially a nail in the coffin of why I'm not interested in a long-term investment. 

Is this going to be something like RKLB, or something closer to Virgin Galactic which had a hype run? The company seems cool in concept, but I'm leaning the latter. 

But hey, in the words of Roman Roy from Succession: ""I don’t mean to be facetious but, Sarah, on that point - I’m not a rocket scientist""

The FAA certification deadline is still 2025 & they’ve got ~$6B in conditional orders from names like United Airlines and the DoD. Big numbers but still conditional & they’re burning cash with a projected $1.32/share loss this year. That said, they’ve got about $1B in liquidity to ride it out

JPMorgan wasn’t the only one weighing in, firms like Needham still have it as a buy at $13.25 average target. Meanwhile, some insiders (CFOs) sold a few million worth, but they still hold sizeable stakes. Institutions like CalSTRS & Private Advisor Group have also increased positions

I guess I’m trying to figure out if this is still a speculative early play on the eVTOL sector or if we’re starting to see a real inflection point with legal risk dropping & institutional interest climbing

Anyone here already holding ACHR or planning to enter? Curious to hear what convinced you either way. Is it about the FAA milestone? The industry tailwinds? Or just betting on Archer specifically vs JOBY & the rest?

Up 40% on RBLX - but is this just the beginning of Roblox becoming the YouTube of immersive worlds?,1mjy16h,Brilliant_Builder697,2025-08-07 11:54:47,15,0.61,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjy16h/up_40_on_rblx_but_is_this_just_the_beginning_of/,"I'm currently up about 40% on RBLX. It's one of the best performers in my portfolio this year. That said, I'm starting to wonder if the valuation is getting ahead of itself… or maybe the market is just correctly pricing it as a long-term compounder now that it's clearly moved beyond being “just a kids’ game.” I’ve been thinking through my thesis here, and while I’ve got a few structured ideas, I’m also very open to feedback. Here’s what I’ve got so far:

**1. Platform Monetization Is Just Getting Started**  
Roblox has gone from raw engagement to a more sophisticated monetization engine, and I think that shift is only just beginning. They’re layering infrastructure and incentives (ads, pricing tools, IP licensing) on top of the existing UGC flywheel. We’re seeing early signs: rewarded video ads are scaling via Google, DevEx payouts are up 52% YoY ($316M), and their new Creator Rewards system is moving away from just time-based payouts toward acquisition and engagement, which is arguably a much healthier structure. Bookings per payer are up 6% YoY, and branded experiences (e.g., Netflix, Sega) suggest IP licensing could become a real revenue stream. All of this supports a potential re-rating on P/S and P/FCF as monetization per DAU improves. Main risk here is that ads could cannibalize IAP or alienate users if poorly implemented.

**2. Global Growth Is Real and Underappreciated**  
The international story is sneaky strong. APAC DAUs are up 76%, bookings up 75% YoY. Indonesia alone is +150%, Korea +120%, India +90%, and Japan +50%. They’ve clearly improved infrastructure (e.g., low-latency servers in Singapore) and localization (auto-translation, regional pricing). The flywheel is kicking in globally. If this trend continues, international markets could provide both DAU and bookings upside, reducing reliance on the U.S. That said, monetization in low-ARPU regions is a risk, and regulatory friction (especially in India or Korea) could become a drag.

**3. Roblox Is Building a Developer OS for the Immersive Economy**  
This is maybe the most exciting angle. They’re not just a game platform, they’re quietly building an operating system for immersive content creation. With tools like Cube 3D (for AI-generated 3D models), Roblox Studio, RoGuard for safety, and better discovery AI, the whole dev stack is becoming much more powerful and user-friendly. There are already over 1 million AI-generated 3D assets live, and build cycles are shortening dramatically. Add in the fact that creators can now monetize physical merch, and we’re looking at an emerging ecosystem that could become to immersive games what Shopify is to ecommerce. Of course, risks include UEFN (Epic) and TikTok’s Project Ripple gaining steam, plus the threat of AI commoditizing content and ongoing moderation burdens.

All this is supported by the rate of change in the financials in almost every single metric.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at. Bullish, but keeping my eyes open. Would love to hear counterpoints or other takes.",2025-08-07,0.9841,Positive,"['RBLX', 'IP', 'UGC', 'IP', 'FCF', 'DAU', 'IAP', 'APAC', 'DAU', 'ARPU', 'OS', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'UEFN', 'AI']"

In a letter to Intel Chair Frank Yeary, released on Wednesday, Cotton cites a probe that found Tan, through his venture firm, Walden International, still holds stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, including chip startups that supply China's military. The Senator wants written proof that Tan has fully divested from any outfit on the Treasury's blacklist, warning that ""Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations. Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.""
   

While there is no ban on Walden International VC company from investing in Chinese startups, Intel is enjoying a significant boost from US funds. In September, Intel was awarded $3 billion in direct funding from the Biden administration under the CHIPS and Science Act for the Secure Enclave program.

Everywhere I look I see them only mentioning semiconductors and or chips. This wording makes me strongly believe that semiconductor equipment is exempt. **Previous with the 15% EU tariffs semiconductor equipment was exempt** and I think the reason is logicial. 

Trump wants to quickly scale the semiconductor/chip making facilities in US in order to do this they would need semiconductor equipment such as **ASML machines and others.** It would make a lot of sense to completely exempt SC equipment to make the investments even more worth it. Ultimately Trumps goal is to get manufacturing back to US. However, the equipment needed from ASML is not something they can do without ASML since it would take years to get to the same level. 

ASML has the problem previousl they cannot sell their most advanced machine to TSMC (China) however with TSMC coming to Arizona I would be believed then ASML can sell the most advanced machines to them as long as its on US soil. Wouldn't this news be incredibly bullish for ASML?

Global debt at all time high, roughly around 389% of gdp correct me if I’m wrong. The obvious reasoning for why we are here is the borrowing in Covid which amplified our debt, the rising rates or flat rates make debt even harder to pay for and a rate cut would do further damage to inflation. 

Us gdp is contracting and slowing aswell as consumer spending and a weak jobs report further leading to a slowdown.

Paramount’s current market capitalization of about $8 billion is one of the lowest in the index, and well below the $22 billion S&P Global requires of new entrants.

S&P considers a company’s float-adjusted market cap and liquidity when determining eligibility, and the Skydance merger could impact both for Paramount. The merger is set to close on Thursday (August 7, 2025), after which the new company will trade under the symbol “PSKY”.

But there won’t be much “PSKY” to trade; per the terms of the agreement, Skydance will own roughly 70% of Paramount’s outstanding shares. That could shrink its float-adjusted value to about $3 billion, an amount S&P Global might consider inappropriate for the index, or too small to ensure adequate liquidity.

Paramount’s merger could be the opportunity investors in Applovin (APP) and Robinhood (HOOD) hoped would come earlier this year. Both were considered top candidates to replace Hess (HESS) in the index when it was acquired by Chevron (CVX) earlier this month. The retail investor favorites easily satisfy S&P’s market cap and profit eligibility criteria, but were passed over in favor of fintech Block (XYZ).

Other top contenders for inclusion would be Interactive Brokers (IBKR), EMCOR (EME), and Comfort Systems USA (FIX), the three largest components of the mid-cap S&P 400.

"Amazon’s Zoox robotaxi unit clears regulatory hurdle, safety probe",1mjf3jm,Puginator,2025-08-06 20:04:22,13,0.84,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mjf3jm/amazons_zoox_robotaxi_unit_clears_regulatory/,"Amazon’s Zoox has cleared a key regulatory hurdle, paving the way for demonstrations of its self-driving robotaxis.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Wednesday that it granted Zoox an exemption from some requirements, a first for U.S.-built vehicles under a recently expanded program.

“Transportation innovators can be confident in getting speedy review of their vehicles and, as appropriate, exemption from Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards,” NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in a release.

The company must remove all existing statements that its purpose-built vehicles meet all federal motor vehicle safety standards.

As part of the announcement, NHTSA said it’s closing a probe opened in March 2023 into Zoox’s self-certification that its robotaxi met federal safety standards.

“Through this new exemption process, we are excited to embark on this new path, put these discussions behind us, and move forward,” Zoox said in a statement.

The Department of Transportation in April announced it would expand a program that aims to speed up the autonomous vehicle exemption process to include domestically produced vehicles. Previously, it was limited to imported AVs.

The easing of regulations will benefit Zoox and its competitors.

Tesla has announced that it plans to produce a two-seater CyberCab with no steering wheel or pedals down the line.

The expansion of the Automated Vehicle Exemption Program could make it easier for the company to conduct testing and operate on public, U.S. roadways if Elon Musk’s automaker can meet the agency’s requirements.

Zoox, founded 11 years ago and purchased by Amazon for $1.3 billion in 2020, has been gearing up for further expansion this year.

The company in June opened a robotaxi manufacturing facility in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it aims to eventually produce 10,000 vehicles a year once it’s at full scale.

Zoox needs more of its toaster-shaped robotaxis to roll off the assembly line to fulfill its mission of deploying a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S.

The company has eyed Las Vegas as its first commercial market, and said it plans to begin service there later this year.

He’s convinced the stock market only makes sense if you’re investing a significant chunk of money: something big enough that it’s worth your time and effort to actively manage.

He even said that if he had a million in cash today, he’d only consider putting 20% into stocks, tops. 
The rest: He’d rather reinvest into his own business or find private ventures where he can call the shots. Basically, he feels like the market takes away control.

That got me curious about how you all see it:
	•	How much money do you realistically think someone needs for investing in stocks to be “worth it”?
	•	How much time do you actually spend (or recommend spending) managing your investments to achieve good returns (better than S&P)?

Personally, I lean toward thinking that if you don’t have the time or desire to dig into research, ETFs are probably the safer bet. But if you’re willing to put in the effort even with smaller amounts, you can definitely find great opportunities. For instance, right now I’m fully invested in Tredegar Corp (TG). I’ve done the deep dive, and it seems clearly undervalued. Plus, respected value investors like Mario Gabelli have a similar outlook, so I feel good about the conviction.

"McDonald’s sees U.S. sales rebound, but concerns about low-income consumers linger",1mj56fq,Puginator,2025-08-06 13:48:55,188,0.93,158,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mj56fq/mcdonalds_sees_us_sales_rebound_but_concerns/,"McDonald’s on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations as buzzy promotions helped its U.S. restaurants rebound.

Despite the chain’s improved performance this quarter, executives are still worried about the economic health of the low-income consumer. McDonald’s is working with its U.S. franchisees on ways to make its core menu items more affordable, beyond the $5 meal deal it rolled out last summer and the newer Daily Double burger promotion.

“Reengaging the low-income consumer is critical, as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle- and high-income consumers,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts on the company’s earnings conference call. “This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the U.S. consumer.”

Executives said they anticipate that McDonald’s results will be stronger in the second half of the year, particularly as the chain faces easier comparisons in the fourth quarter to the fallout from last year’s E. coil outbreak.

Shares of the company rose more than 2% in morning trading.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $3.19 adjusted vs. $3.15 expected
* **Revenue:** $6.84 billion vs. $6.7 billion expected

The fast-food giant reported second-quarter net income of $2.25 billion, or $3.14 per share, up from $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring charges and other items, McDonald’s earned $3.19 per share.

Revenue rose 5% to $6.84 billion. Kempczinski credited the chain’s value, marketing and new menu items for the 6% increase in system sales during the quarter.

Same-store sales, a metric that only tracks the performance of restaurants that have been open at least a year, increased 3.8%, the chain’s biggest jump in nearly two years.

McDonald’s U.S. restaurants saw same-store sales growth of 2.5%, reversing two straight quarters of domestic declines. Kempczinski said the burger chain outperformed its rivals by both same-store sales and comparable traffic.

“Certainly, overall \[quick-service restaurant\] traffic in the U.S. remained challenging, as visits across the industry by low-income consumers once again declined by double digits versus the prior year period,” he said.

This quarter, the burger chain’s U.S. sales received a boost from a tie-in meal with the “Minecraft” movie and the launch of the McCrispy Chicken Strips.

Shortly after the quarter ended, Snack Wraps returned to menus for the first time in nine years; executives said that early results are “encouraging,” and franchisees have voted to maintain the $2.99 promotional price through the end of the year.

Outside the U.S., demand for its Big Macs and french fries was even stronger.

“I would just note, also on our international side, it’s not as competitive a market as it is in the U.S.,” Kempczinski said. “I think it’s a little bit easier for us to stand out and represent good value in international.”

The chain’s international developmental licensed markets division, which includes Japan and China, reported same-store sales growth of 5.6%.

Its international operated markets segment saw same-store sales growth of 4%, thanks to gains in markets like the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. Executives said McDonald’s value and affordability scores from consumers have improved in key markets.

CFO Hugh Johnston credited the quarter in part to the success of Disney’s streaming unit, anchored by its flagship service, Disney+.

“Just as a reminder, it was only a couple of years ago that we were losing a billion dollars a quarter on that business,” Johnston told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday. “It was trading purely on subs and not on financial results. We now really have a solid foundation.”

The growth in streaming has recently started to help to supplant the losses of the cash cow traditional TV business, which has been bleeding customers for years now.

Disney shares were down 2% in premarketing trading Wednesday.

Here is what Disney reported for the quarter ended June 28 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.61 adjusted vs. $1.47 expected
* **Revenue:** $23.65 billion vs. $23.73 billion expected

Net income for the quarter was $5.26 billion, or $2.92 per share, more than double the $2.62 billion, or $1.43 a share, that the company reported for the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time items, primarily related to tax benefits associated with Disney’s purchase of Comcast’s Hulu stake, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.61. 

Disney’s overall revenue rose 2% to $23.65 billion, missing analyst expectations for the first time since May 2024. 

The company reported continued growth in its streaming business despite headwinds in the traditional TV bundle, which has suffered from declining customers. 

Disney upped its fiscal 2025 guidance on Wednesday and now expects adjusted EPS of $5.85 – an increase of 18% from fiscal 2024. In May, Disney issued guidance for expected full-year adjusted EPS of $5.75.

* **Revenue:** $12.65 billion vs. $12.46 billion expected.

Here are the key segment numbers:

* **Mobility (gross bookings):** $23.76 billion, up 18% year over year
* **Delivery (gross bookings):** $21.73 billion, up 20% year over year

Uber’s revenue increased 18% from $10.7 billion a year earlier. For the quarter ending June 30, net income rose to $1.36 billion, or 63 cents per share, from $1.02 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year ago.

Gross bookings rose 17% to $46.8 billion, and the company reported adjusted earnings of $2.12 billion.

“At this point, we’re not seeing weakness in the consumer,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Wednesday. “It’s steady as she goes, and for Uber, that’s great news.”

Uber’s “monthly active platform consumers” increased 15% to 180 million in the second quarter. The company said users booked around 3.3 billion trips during the period, up 18% from a year earlier.

* **Revenue:** $2.68 billion vs. $2.55 billion

Second-quarter sales surged 31% year over year to $2.68 billion, an acceleration from a year ago, when revenue expanded roughly 20%.

The Canadian e-commerce company also offered third-quarter guidance that surpassed expectations. Shopify said it expects revenue to grow at a “mid-to-high twenties percentage rate” year over year, which is higher than the 21.7% growth projected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

The upbeat report and guidance suggested Shopify, which sells software for e-commerce businesses, is navigating President Donald Trump’s trade war better than feared. Last quarter, the company noted there was macroeconomic “uncertainty ahead,” but that it wasn’t seeing significant price increases among its merchants due to the tariffs.

“We had factored into our guidance some potential impact from tariffs, which did not materialize,” Shopify CFO Jeff Hoffmeister said on a conference call with investors.

Valuations are stretched, even for companies with slowing earnings. Feels like everyone’s ignoring guidance cuts.

Credit markets are starting to flash yellow, with higher yields and widening spreads. That’s often where cracks show up first.

Retail enthusiasm is off the charts. IPOs, meme stocks, options it’s 2021 energy all over again.

Globally, we’ve got political uncertainty, slowing growth in China, and energy risks brewing.

Not saying a crash is guaranteed, markets can stay irrational longer than we expect but the setup feels… fragile.

Anyone else getting that gut feeling that the next few months could be rough? Or am I just overthinking every headline?

The company's operating profit has also seen a significant increase of 25% in Danish kroner and 29% at CER, amounting to DKK 72.2 billion. In the US, sales grew by 16% in Danish kroner (17% at CER), notably influenced by adjustments related to prior years, including a DKK 3 billion adjustment for the 340B provision in the second quarter. International operations experienced a sales increase of 16% in Danish kroner and 19% at CER. Despite these strong first-half results, Novo Nordisk has revised its full-year outlook downwards.

In Danish kroner, this growth is expected to be 3 and 5 percentage points lower, respectively.

Lionsgate Studios Analysis Play,1mitfc2,HunterMichael92,2025-08-06 02:57:29,14,0.66,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mitfc2/lionsgate_studios_analysis_play/,"Disclosure: I own 685,000 shares. 

Thank you everyone for your interest in this post and Lionsgate Studios

2. Why Lionsgate?

There's plenty of tech stocks out there that we can buy today as well that have high multiples; however, there's only one set of libraries that sum 20,000 titles that all streamers in North America will be licensing for the indefinite future. Sure,  international rights may have been sold in many instances to finance a handful of the library; however, North America rights are very much intact.

3. Why would you buy a company that is invested in a dying industry?

Home television is very far from dead. People are paying more now than ever between the Apple TV, Paramount, Amazon, Netflix's, etc. of the world. Just because in person attendance at theaters has dropped, home box office is very strong.

There is also a high barrier to entry to replicate what has already been created. Not only are the Lionsgate films included here, do some research on their subsidiaries and the respective rights they own to many more films outside just Lionsgate's purview.

4. The company has high debt, why would someone want to acquire Lionsgate?

If Lionsgate was taken out by a major player for cash/stock, the debt is not of concern to the acquirer as their enterprise value would absorb this debt without hesitation or handle it as they wish upon acquisition. The value of this library to a single player or a private equity fund who wants to just control the licensing renewals for the decades to come can make this a cash flow positive business with minimal effort. Especially considering that the streaming wars are still very much alive, and companies are pouring millions, if not billions collectively into assets, AI, and technology.

5. The stock is near its all time low, why is this still a good buy?

Waiting. People naturally today do not want to wait for any gratification. However, one press release will immediately turn this stock into a top performer as suitors become known publicly. Even if the stock drops 10% due to a delayed news cycle on acquisition, wouldn't that still out perform the market if we end up at $7.25+ a year from now or sooner, let alone $13?

I welcome all questions but wanted to focus on the fact that I did not post this to create an exit, if anything, I will be acquiring more shares if we stay below the $6/share mark for long.

Wishing everyone great investments, profits, and long term value.

Norway Breaks New EV Sales Record in July as Tesla’s Model Y retained its title as Norway’s best-selling individual vehicle in July,1misfld,Pretty_Positive9866,2025-08-06 02:09:55,5,0.54,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1misfld/norway_breaks_new_ev_sales_record_in_july_as/,"Norway has once again solidified its position as the world leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, setting a new benchmark in July 2025. According to figures released by the Norwegian Road Traffic Information Council ([OFV](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-model-y-leads-in-norway-and-spain-as-european-sales-rebound-in-june/)), battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for a staggering 97.2% of all new passenger car registrations for the month.

Add plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) to the equation, and that pushes the total EV share to an unprecedented 98.2%.

This milestone comes amid a broader surge in Norway’s EV transition, with July’s total new vehicle registrations reaching 9,563 48% year-over-year increase and the highest July volume since 2021. Of these, 9,291 were full battery-electric vehicles, while just 272 vehicles sold were not EVs, showcasing the near-total dominance of electric mobility in the country.

Traditionally a quieter month due to summer holidays, July’s strong sales figures were kept strong by an interest rate cut and lingering consumer demand from earlier orders. Øyvind Solberg Thorsen, director of the OFV, emphasized that many of the vehicles registered had been ordered months in advance, noting that long lead times for certain models are still affecting deliveries.

Tesla’s Model Y retained its title as Norway’s best selling individual vehicle in July, with 715 units registered. However, the American automaker no longer enjoys the dominance it once held. Tesla fell to fourth place among electric car brands for the month, with only 123 other Tesla vehicles registered outside of the Model Y. Volkswagen claimed the top spot with 1,116 total registrations, followed by Volvo, Skoda, and MG highlighting the growing strength of European and Chinese EV brands in the Norwegian market.

Apple is going no where, however, the hype for their products is just dwindling.

The Vision Pro was a complete bust. 

Apple services is not doing well. Apple TV is burning money. Most of the gen z people I know use Spotify, not Apple Music. 

What’s next? A $2,000 foldable phone? There’s a limit to what people will spend on Apple products, and we saw that with the Vision Pro.

Lucid softens full-year production forecast as EV maker misses second-quarter estimates,1mikc1v,Puginator,2025-08-05 20:25:41,12,0.81,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mikc1v/lucid_softens_fullyear_production_forecast_as_ev/,"Lucid Group on Tuesday softened its production outlook for the rest of the year as it reported second-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations.

The electric vehicle maker now anticipates producing between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles for the year after previously projecting a goal of 20,000.

Shares of Lucid fell more than 9% in after-hours trading Tuesday.

Here’s what the company reported in the three-month period ended June 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Loss per share:** 24 cents adjusted vs. a loss of 21 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $259 million vs. $280 million expected

The company reported a net loss for the quarter of $855 million, or 28 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $790 million, or 34 cents per share, in the same period last year. Excluding restructuring and other one-time costs, the company posted an adjusted loss per share of 24 cents for the quarter.

Lucid’s total costs and expenses were up roughly 7.5% from the same period last year, at $1.06 billion.

The automaker said it ended the quarter with roughly $4.86 billion in total liquidity.

Last month, Lucid announced that Uber would invest $300 million in the company as part of a partnership to deploy more than 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. It’s also been trying to build its brand awareness, in part by tapping actor Timothée Chalamet to star in a new ad campaign.

But Lucid has been burning through cash as it works to ramp up production of its Gravity SUV, its second vehicle after the Air sedan.

“We are focused on business fundamentals to achieve our near-term goals: disciplined cost management, brand building, and continuing to execute our Lucid Gravity launch ramp,” CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said in a release.

Lucid said in July that it delivered 3,309 vehicles in the second quarter, a 38.2% increase compared with the same period in 2024, but short of analyst expectations.

Demand for pure electric vehicles has been slower than expected, and consumers have been gravitating toward cheaper hybrids.

The industry is also bracing for the impact of President Donald Trump’s new tax-and-spending bill, which he signed into law on July 4. That legislation is set to end the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 credit for used EVs after Sept. 30.

Lucid stock has fallen nearly 19% so far this year as of Tuesday’s close.

Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street’s expectations:

* **Earnings per share:** Loss of 16 cents. That figure is not comparable to analysts’ estimates.
* **Revenue:** $1.34 billion vs. $1.35 billion expected, according to LSEG 
* **Global daily active users:** 469 million vs. 467 million expected, according to StreetAccount
* **Global average revenue per user:** $2.87 vs. $2.90 expected, according to StreetAccount

Snap said its second-quarter sales grew 9% year over year while it recorded a net loss of $262.6 million. The company’s net loss during the same quarter last year was $248.6 million.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the second quarter came in at $41 million, trailing the $53 million that StreetAccount was projecting.

Snap said third-quarter revenue will come in between $1.475 billion and $1.505 billion, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $1.475 billion.

The company said adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter will be in the range between $110 million and $135 million. That figure’s midpoint of $122.5 million is higher than StreetAccount’s projections of $116 million.

Snap said third-quarter global daily active users will total 476 million, roughly in line with the 475.7 million StreetAccount is expecting.

The company’s Snapchat+ subscription service is approaching 16 million in the second quarter, representing a 42% year-over-year increase, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel wrote in an investor letter. Snap’s subscription service is the “largest driver” to the company’s Other Revenue category, rising 64% year over year to $171 million in the second quarter, Spiegel said.

Snap’s adjusted operating expenses for the second quarter rose 10% year over year to $654 million, Spiegel said in the letter.

Spiegel said in an investor letter that it will be “distributing” its engineering teams to “directly support” its business functions, resulting in its core applications team reporting to tech chief Bobby Murphy. The monetization engineering team will be reporting to business chief Ajit Mohan.

“Our Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer will report to me and lead enterprise-wide foundational infrastructure and platform integrity,” Spiegel said in the letter. “This new, distributed structure will empower our teams to take greater ownership and drive continued innovation for our community and advertising partners.”

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Ironically, commenters should have listened to the quote they were attempting to mock - be greedy when others are fearful. 

When the tariff fears were at their peak in April and market was down 16% YTD, I couldn’t believe the comments I was seeing all over reddit. This is just a small sampling of pure panic comments that had a lot of upvotes. 

Of course, hindsight is 20/20 and I wouldn’t be posting this if we never recovered. And I’m not saying we are out of the woods yet or shouldn’t expect another correction. However, something has to be said when the people who champion DCA and time in the market > timing the market completely crumble during a correction. 

Two takeaways:
- You must have high conviction in your investing strategy. I am a permanent, long term BULL and will always buy and hold. I will only get out of the market if I need emergency money or society as we know it is collapsing (in which case money would be useless anyway).
- The Reddit (and internet at large) hive mind is real. The sentiment on these subs could not have been lower in April yet here we are, doing alright in my opinion.

My post history will outline many of the reasons why, but I think I've finally had to come to accept that this market will never see the likes of a massive, dot com, global financial crisis style correction ever again.

A global pandemic that shut the world down couldn't do it (SPY found a new high within 6 months).

Global conflict cannot do it -- the world is as to nuclear war as it's been since the collapse of the USSR.

Ridiculous valuations cannot do it -- The SPY is trading at a P/E that was only higher during dot com, GFC, and for one quarter after COVID hit -- at any point in the last 125+ years.

Bank failures cannot do it -- The failures of signature bank, silicon valley bank, and first republic banks, by assets under management, were larger than all the bank failures combined of the +/- 450 banks that failed in 08.

Rising delinquency rates in auto loans and credit card debt, paired with the highest balances on consumer debt in history have no effect.

A failing commercial real estate sector has no impact.

High interest rates, paired with an unaffordability crisis in the housing sector, means that a majority of Americans can no longer afford to buy a home... irrelevant.

Global trade wars that tank the market 20% only have the ability to hold that price action for 4 months before the market finds new highs.

Tesla shareholders are rejoicing as it is more likely to pay Elon $29 Billion instead of $50 Billion,1mhc1tt,Progress_8,2025-08-04 12:27:49,1375,0.93,236,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mhc1tt/tesla_shareholders_are_rejoicing_as_it_is_more/,"[Reuters/Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-approves-96-million-share-102426782.html)

Sentiment across eVTOLs is clearly cooling off after the hype wave earlier this year & Archer’s still pre revenue, which means every move is amplified. No news from the company, just light volume & some options hedging

JPMorgan raised their price target from $9 to $10 but still kept a Neutral rating. They flagged cash burn and delays in revenue as key risks (nothing new) & called the recent market behavior *irrational exuberance.* Not wrong, but a PT bump is still a bullish tell

They also don’t expect Trump’s executive order *(which explicitly supports advanced air mobility)* to impact earnings soon but let’s be real, that kind of policy shift helps the long term narrative.

Technicals are a mixed bag right now. MACD shows a buy, but 20 day and 50 day EMAs are still above the current price, so short term traders are treating this like a downtrend. Doesn’t change my thesis.

The stock is still trading with speculative energy, but that’s how early-stage bets work. Analysts are still leaning bullish with a “Moderate Buy” consensus & a $11.92 PT *(almost 24% upside from here).*

For ACHR to rerate higher, they’ll need to deliver clean earnings, show progress on certification milestones, and eventually break into revenue territory. Until then, volatility is just part of the package.

If you’re in from $12+, sure, that hurts. But sub $10 is a zone I’ll keep nibbling. Not saying it moons tomorrow, but I’d rather build a position now than chase it later on a surprise catalyst",2025-08-04,0.9676,Positive,"['ACHR', 'PT', 'MACD', 'PT', 'ACHR']"
Since BLS Reports are about to lose relevance/credibility what other reports are you watching? ADP maybe?,1mh9dwk,Educational_Face_610,2025-08-04 10:05:08,117,0.86,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mh9dwk/since_bls_reports_are_about_to_lose/,"Let’s be real. If Trump wins and drops one of his people into the BLS, the jobs report is toast. Fully cooked. We’re talking “everything is fine” vibes while the economy bleeds out.

This isn’t tinfoil hat territory either. It’s already kind of happening. Look at May 2025: the BLS initially reported 139,000 jobs added. Two months later, that got revised down to 19,000. That’s not a small miss. That’s a total rewrite of the story.

Meanwhile, ADP reported 37,000 for that same month. Not perfect, but a hell of a lot closer than the BLS fantasy number. And that’s the point. ADP pulls data from actual payrolls at real companies. BLS does surveys and then layers on seasonal adjustments, revisions, and eventually, political spin.

Now imagine a loyalist takes over and starts reporting whatever number they’re told to print. Ten million jobs? Sure. Zero layoffs? Why not. Reality doesn’t matter when the data becomes a political weapon.

At this point, I’m not even watching the BLS numbers anymore. If the market still reacts to them, fine, but I’m treating them like CPI. Rigged until proven otherwise.

Here’s what I’m actually watching:
	•	ADP payroll data – based on real checks, not surveys
	•	Challenger job cuts – tells you when companies are getting nervous
	•	LinkedIn and Indeed job posting trends – real-time demand
	•	Conference Board employment index – solid composite signal
	•	Household Pulse Survey – faster, less manipulated than BLS

If we’re headed into a manipulated-data economy, I want to at least be looking at something closer to the truth. The BLS used to matter, but if the next admin turns it into a propaganda machine, it’s just another lagging indicator that lies.

Is Jerome Powell doing the right thing by holding rates higher for longer?,1mgq1b5,Cobra25k,2025-08-03 18:06:11,0,0.46,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mgq1b5/is_jerome_powell_doing_the_right_thing_by_holding/,"Jerome Powell absolutely knows the labor market is weakening under the surface, but he’s jawboning intentionally when he keeps saying “the labor market is strong” and the “Economy is solid.”

There is no way Powell can truthfully say the labor market is strong when:

Leading economic indicators continue to plummet.

Quits rate is the Lowest since 2020 (shows workers don’t feel confident to switch jobs).

Job openings (JOLTS) Down 30%+ from 2022.

Temp employment which is a Leading recession signal; already rolling over.

Part-time employment is Declining, often a softening sign.

Initial + Continuing claims Trending higher for months.

Massive revisions in non-farm payrolls show we are near stall speed and at risk of loosing jobs on a monthly basis 

We know Powell tracks all these LEADING indicators, but he keeps focusing on Lagging indicators like the headline U-3 unemployment rate as an excuse to keeps rates higher for longer. But the problem is when Jerome finally see’s degradation in these lagging indicators, the recession will already be underway and it will be too late. And that appears to be okay with him.

On the other hand, If Powell admits the labor market is cracking then…

-Bond yields plummet

-Stocks rally

-Financial conditions loosen

Which undoes his entire inflation-fighting narrative, which is clearly his #1 priority with unknown inflation effects from tariffs looming. 

Powell is managing psychology, not just data. Admitting weakness too early and then having inflation re-accelerate (via tariffs, services, housing) would destroy his credibility. He’d rather look “late” than prematurely ease and risk a 1970s-style stagflation repeat.

Powell is playing a high-stakes communication game. He knows the cracks are forming. He’s just not ready to say it out loud, yet.

The Fed’s Nightmare Scenario: Premature Easing

Powell’s #1 fear isn’t a shallow recession, it’s:

1. Easing too early which results in Financial conditions loosen

2. Inflation re-accelerates, Especially via core services, housing, tariffs

3. The Fed loses credibility, Then has to hike again (1970s Volcker trap)

He would rather:

-Be late

-Let the economy contract

-Cut hard and swift once the damage is visible in the lagging indicators.

Powell is executing a deliberate strategy of delayed response, knowing that:

1. The small chance that the labor doesn’t break, He wins, no need to cut.

2. The more likely case that the labor does break, He cuts hard and fast, accepting the recession.

It’s not that he believes a recession is avoidable. It’s that he’s accepting recession risk in exchange for inflation control.

So the ultimate question is, if you think we should be trying to avoid a recession altogether and that tariff induced inflation is transitory in nature, then the Fed should already be cutting and Jerome Powell is Indeed “too late.” 

However, if you think it’s more important to guarantee that inflation is 100% completely stamped out for good, and that it’s worth the risk of having a recession to guarantee that, then the Fed is correctly keeping rates higher for longer. ",2025-08-03,-0.9923,Negative,['JOLTS']

Here are the BLS Non-Farm Payrolls numbers for October, November, and December of 2007, based on the final revised figures:

October 2007: +103,000 jobs

Yes, the headline U3 unemployment rate hit a cycle high at 4.25% but in absolute terms that’s still a very low unemployment rate. However, we must take into account that Bureau of Labor Statistics Non-Farm payroll job numbers lead the U3 unemployment rate. 

Mainly because the U3 unemployment rate often stays lower for longer because even as layoffs increase, until unemployed individuals actually remain out of work long enough, they won’t affect the headline number.

Atlassian (TEAM) Rovo + Vertical Ecosystem Be Its Moment?,1mgm7st,Rocketiger,2025-08-03 15:33:16,6,0.69,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mgm7st/atlassian_team_rovo_vertical_ecosystem_be_its/,"I’m thinking about whether Atlassian’s AI-powered Rovo, tied to its vertically integrated ecosystem, could spark an “iPod moment” like Apple’s in 2003. Back then, Apple was a niche PC player, and the iPod + iTunes ecosystem made them a consumer titan. Atlassian’s in a similar spot strong with its interconnected suite (Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket) used by 83% of Fortune 500, but middle-tier against Microsoft, ServiceNow, and GitLab.


Rovo’s an AI platform baked into Atlassian’s tightly knit ecosystem, connecting Jira (dev), Confluence (docs), Trello (tasks), and Bitbucket (code) with third-party tools like Slack and Google Drive. Its unified search pulls contextual data across these tools, Rovo Chat answers queries with company-specific insights, and Rovo Agents automate tasks like backlog cleanup or code reviews. It’s powered by the Teamwork Graph (20+ years of workflow data) and free for Premium/Enterprise users.


Could Rovo’s integration with Atlassian’s vertical system where tools share data and workflows seamlessly be a game changer? It tackles pain points of work time spent searching. Rovo’s no-code agents let teams customize workflows, keeping them in Atlassian’s orbit, much like iTunes locked users into Apple’s ecosystem.


Microsoft’s Copilot and ServiceNow’s AI are tough competitors with bigger ecosystems. And B2B sales cycles are slower than the iPod’s consumer boom. Atlassian’s open integrations, unlike Apple’s walled garden, might limit lock-in. What do you think? Can Rovo make Atlassian the enterprise AI leader, or is it just another feature?

[CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)

Both Governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, sought a 25-basis-point reduction, as maintaining the status quo poses risks to the economy. Noted tariffs have only a temporary impact on inflation. These dissents are the first time two governors have done so since 1993.

Bowman (who also serves as the Fed’s vice chair for bank supervision) stated, “I see the risk that a delay in taking action could result in a deterioration in the labor market and a further slowing in economic growth.”

Their statements, as well as Powell's statement, came before the huge correction in the job data. The Labor Department report on Friday showed that nonfarm payrolls rose by just 73,000 in July, below expectations, while the June and May counts were revised lower by a combined 258,000, which showed virtually no growth for both months.

Some suggested that the Fed might have cut rates if the July jobs report had come before this past Wednesday's meeting. Powell's tone would also probably have been much more dovish if the job data corrections were known beforehand.

but how the heck do you ""repurchase"" something in the past? The *30 days after* part makes perfect sense to me, just not the 30 days before part.

I've felt lately like no matter how diligent I am about keeping up with the market, I still somehow end up missing out on some substantial gains just because I wasn't on top of specific news or catalysts in a timely manner. It's maddening because sometimes it's out there, but it's buried in a whole lot of noise or just hard to keep up with on a real-time basis.

I've been thinking about it: imagine there was a service that filtered out all the noise and delivered only the most significant micro-catalysts that have the potential to drive stocks like FDA filings, insider buying, odd lot options activity, SEC filings and breaks down what they mean in plain terms with actionable ideas?

Do you struggle to miss these smaller but potent events? How do you stay on top of them presently?  
Does a service like the one I just suggested even exist?

Seriously curious to know your thoughts and how you manage this. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

  
EDIT: I thought I should clarify, by ""trading"", I buy and DCA into stocks that I believe will outperform the market in the short term based on the news catalysts. My trading timeframe is holding onto stocks for 6+ months, but recently I've been seeing opportunities such as Figma's IPO, the passing of the Genius Act, e.t.c that have sent stocks soaring.

Microsoft finally revealed Azures true revenue.

Looks like this time, they finally caved and reported numbers. The growth always looked sus to me in the real world given everyone anecdotally swears by AWS and I know very few who use Azures compute or data infrastructures. 

Azure made $75B in the year, apparently growing 34% YoY. GCP is at $50B and AWS is at $111B. AWS has a sizable 32% lead over Microsoft here. 

AWS is also growing 18% and accelerating. But if we assume it stays at say 20% and Azure stays at 35%, it’s catching up by 15% a year. Applying simple compounding, this means Azure will take 3-4 years to reach parity with AWS around the $200B mark. 

Satya is super strategic. Why would he reveal Azure numbers now? Many analysts think it’s because Azure only recently showed that it has a shot of catching AWS due to OpenAI demand. Microsoft is paying openAI which is then paying Microsoft back for using azure compute. 

The future of cloud dominance is all going to come down to openAI carrying Azure growth vs the strength of their combined competitors like Anthropic, llama, Gemini, etc. Anthropic already has better models for some use cases. GPT is also not exclusive to Microsoft and already available on GCP. 

This is not even getting into profitability. We don’t know if Azure is profitable with the AI workloads. Microsoft hasn’t reported those numbers yet. But we do know AWS is printing money and has been even before AI. 

This is going to be an interesting 3 years. I think AI models are increasingly reaching parity. So if there’s no competitive advantage between them, I fully expect AWS to retain and even expand their lead as they simply offer a better product, prices, experience and support.

In this chart there's a consolidation phase at left, until at the end the price breaks out generating a tall green candle where price goes up violently. That day the volume is very high too.

I'd say that smart money was buying silently several months in smaller amounts until they bought massively on August causing the price to rise a lot.

But why the price almost did not go up during all those months. The price was around $18, they purchased small amounts, not great impact on price until the August day where the big green candle shows up, didn't he pay $18 too? Is the fact that they purchased a LOT of stocks in the same order (or day) what causes the price to go up until $22?)

The payout includes $129 million in compensatory damages, and $200 million in punitive damages against Tesla. Attorneys for the plaintiffs had asked the jury to award damages of around $345 million. The trial in the Southern District of Florida started on July 14.

The suit centered around who shouldered the blame for the deadly crash in Key Largo, Florida. A Tesla owner named George McGee was driving his Model S electric sedan while using the company’s Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system.

While driving, McGee dropped his mobile phone that he was using and scrambled to pick it up. He said during the trial that he believed Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. His Model S accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, hitting a nearby empty parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle.

Naibel Benavides, who was 22, died on the scene from injuries sustained in the crash. Her body was discovered about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury and psychological effects.

"State of U.S. Tariffs: August 1, 2025",1mf181l,quant_0,2025-08-01 16:33:10,67,0.92,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mf181l/state_of_us_tariffs_august_1_2025/,"The Budget Lab (TBL) estimated the effects all US tariffs and foreign retaliation implemented in 2025 through July 31, including the new list of “reciprocal” tariffs to take effect August 7. TBL analyzed the July 31 tariff rates as if they stayed in effect in perpetuity.

Current Tariff Rate: Consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.3%, the highest since 1934. After consumption shifts, the average tariff rate will be 17.3%, the highest since 1935.

Overall Price Level & Distributional Effects: The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 1.8% in the short-run, the equivalent of an average per household income loss of $2,400 in 2025$. This assumes the Federal Reserve does not react to tariffs and so the real income adjustment comes primarily through prices rather than nominal incomes; if the Federal Reserve reacted, the adjustment could in part come in the form of lower nominal incomes. Annual pre-substitution losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are $1,300. The post-substitution price increase settles at 1.5%, a $2,000 loss per household.

Commodity Prices: The 2025 tariffs disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with consumers facing 40% higher shoe prices and 38% higher apparel prices in the short-run. Shoes and apparel prices stay 19% and 17% higher in the long-run respectively.

Real GDP Effects: US real GDP growth over 2025 and 2026 is -0.5pp lower each year from all 2025 tariffs. In the long-run, the US economy is persistently -0.4% smaller, the equivalent of $120 billion annually in 2024$.

Labor Market Effects: The unemployment rate rises 0.3 percentage point by the end of 2025 and 0.7 percentage point by the end of 2026. Payroll employment is 497,000 lower by the end of 2025.

Long-Run Sectoral GDP & Employment Effects: In the long-run, tariffs present a trade-off. US manufacturing output expands by 2.1%, but these gains are more than crowded out by other sectors: construction output contracts by 3.5% and agriculture declines by 0.9%.

Fiscal Effects: All tariffs to date in 2025 raise $2.7 trillion over 2026-35, with $466 billion in negative dynamic revenue effects, bringing dynamic revenues to $2.2 trillion.

AMD is evolving from a chip supplier to a full-fledged AI computing platform player,1mey6ge,aemsi99,2025-08-01 14:36:56,104,0.89,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mey6ge/amd_is_evolving_from_a_chip_supplier_to_a/,"The MI350 is close enough to Nvidia's performance that AMD can finally charge something closer to a premium price. This chip is no longer just an affordable alternative - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads. Most importantly, this is the “early inflection point” in the changing competitive landscape you've been watching.



Revenue and margin gains are real 

At higher average selling prices, AMD has been able to grow significantly without having to dramatically increase volume. Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.



The market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.



Major customers could be behind this move 

AMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.



AMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing 

Even at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of “value and performance,” and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.



Risks remain, but the narrative is changing 

Headwinds remain. China's export restrictions could result in a revenue reduction of \~$800 million in the second half of 2025, and it is unclear if or when licenses will resume. mi355x needs to be released smoothly and continue the momentum of mi350 - any issues with the software or system will be closely watched. rocm is still lagging behind CUDA in developer adoption. Still lagging behind CUDA in terms of adoption, but improving: ROCm now offers day one support for LLaMA 4 and there are over 2 million models optimized for AMD GPUs on Hugging Face.



Overall 

This indicates a shift in AMD's strategy. It supports our broader view that the company is no longer confined to the role of low-cost alternative, but is moving towards leadership in AI computing. If these pricing trends continue - and especially if they trigger even a modest “ahead-of-the-curve” cycle - the market may begin to reassess AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a platform company. As these fundamentals strengthen, the technological breakthroughs we've seen from AMD, especially relative to NVIDIA, could begin to gain real staying power.",2025-08-01,0.9921,Positive,"['AMD', 'AI', 'AMD', 'GPU', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'GPU', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'META', 'ORCL', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AI', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'CUDA', 'CUDA', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AI', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AMD']"
"The most overlooked, undervalued, recession proof, opportunity in this macro environment: $EZPW",1mey3aw,Itsyournamebackwards,2025-08-01 14:33:29,14,0.67,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mey3aw/the_most_overlooked_undervalued_recession_proof/,"**Something big happened Wednesday night and nobody’s talking about it.**

EZCORP ($EZPW), of all companies, posted a stealthy *double beat*: earnings up 33.6%, revenue up 2.8%. No flashy branding, no AI, no datacenter capital burn. Just... pawnshops.

This is a company built on *short-term credit* and *collateralized lending*. And while everyone’s been watching Nvidia, this pawn empire (with operations across the U.S. and Latin America) is quietly riding the wave of inflation, tighter credit, and gold appreciation.

**Macro tailwinds: tighter credit environment, inflation and gold price**

The Fed's not cutting rates. Credit card APRs are soaring 25%+. Inflation is likely rising. Subprime borrowers are getting squeezed harder than a lime at a Mezcal tasting. Enter EZCORP. In short: banks are saying “no,” and EZCORP is saying “show me your gold chain.”

These are **non-recourse loans**. No bank account required, no credit checks. Just cash on the spot. It’s old-school lending but scaled. EZCORP now runs **1,284 stores**, including Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.

And here’s the kicker: the **average U.S. loan** they give out is up to **$207**, from $185 last year, partly because gold prices are climbing. That means more revenue per transaction, backed by assets they can resell

# Q2 FY25: EZCORP’s quiet blowout

|Metric|Q2 FY25|YoY Growth|
|:-|:-|:-|

|Revenue|$318.9M|\+12%|
|Pawn Loans Outstanding (PLO)|$271.8M|\+15%|
|EBITDA|$45.1M|\+23%|

|Merchandise Sales|$177.4M|\+8%|
|Gross Profit|$185.0M|\+10%|
|Cash on Balance Sheet|505.2M|Up 3x QoQ|

And yet? **Wall Street barely blinked.**  
Yes - the stock is up 8%, but still it's a very cheap business, if we are considering the valuations...

* EPS (annualized): \~$1.36
* PEG ratio (15% est. growth): **0.73**
* Forward P/E: \~10.5
* Analyst PT: **$21-$22**

* **Implied upside: \~47%**

Assumptions:

* FCF starting point: $107.6M (TTM) *NOTE: Strong YoY growth of* ***+232%***  *driven by both operational efficiency and the refinancing event in Q2 FY25.*
* Growth: 10% (5 years), Terminal: 3%
* WACC: 9%
* Diluted shares outstanding: 83.1M

→ **Fair Value Estimate: ± $20.5/share**

Even under conservative assumptions, this stock trades at a **meaningful discount to intrinsic value**.

# Short interest: quietly squeezable?

* **Short Float:** 17.96%
* **Short Interest:** 8.89M shares
* **Days to Cover:** 9.36
* **Short Shares Available:** Just 1.7M

# Charting the breakout: RSI, Channel, and Volume say Yes

On the **monthly chart**, EZPW has:

* Held a long-term **uptrend channel** since 2020
* Shown **bullish divergence** on RSI
* Seen **increased volume and positive MACD crossover**
* Strong support around $12.50–13.00
* Key resistance ahead at \~$15.80 and $21.00

The setup is textbook: consistent higher lows, a bullish RSI trendline, and increasing conviction.

**Institutional confidence + smart money quietly accumulating**

While EZCORP doesn’t make headlines, it does sit in portfolios run by **BlackRock (owns ± 15.7%), Vanguard (owns ±5.9%), and Dimensional Fund Advisors (± owns 6.7)**. Together they hold a substantial interest in the business of ±28%. On top, recent repurchases by management (albeit modest) signal quiet confidence, and the company still sits under most radar screens. A value trap for shorts, and a value *play* for those with a spine.

**Scaling the unsexy way: EZCORP’s inner Costco**

Pawnshops aren’t new. But scaling a pawn *empire* across Latin America? That’s innovation via *distribution*. EZCORP has added **44 new stores YoY**, including 9 de novo LatAm locations and 1 acquisition.

What’s more impressive:

* 6.2M EZ+ Rewards users, up 34%
* 25% growth in online luxury sales via **Max Pawn eBay channel**
* 30% of U.S. stores now offer “view online, buy in-store”
* 15% jump in layaways after launching longer terms

Like **Costco**, EZCORP focuses on **volume, repeat traffic, and margin control**. Just with Rolexes instead of rotisserie chickens.

# Final words: great entry

EZCORP isn’t riding a hype cycle. It’s riding the *macro reality* that millions of people are financially squeezed and need fast, dignified access to cash. EZCORP is the kind of business that thrives when the economy doesn’t. Worth a look.

It’s a profitable, cash-rich business, growing smartly in emerging markets, sitting on a short interest keg, and trading at a discount. What’s not to like?

**✔ PEG < 1**  
**✔ Cash-rich, debt-refinanced**  
**✔ Short-squeeze setup**  
**✔ Long-term macro tailwind**  
**✔ Undervalued vs. peers**

Enjoy the pawnside of capitalism.

"EU-US Steel Agreement Stalemate: Tariffs Remain in Place, Quota Negotiations Will Determine the Fate of the Steel Sector",1mewviq,Khazash,2025-08-01 13:44:09,7,0.83,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mewviq/euus_steel_agreement_stalemate_tariffs_remain_in/,"What happened?

The EU and the US have just reached a broad trade agreement imposing a 15% tariff on EU exports (covering automobiles, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and other sectors), avoiding the originally planned 30% punitive tariff.

However, steel and aluminum remain subject to tariffs as high as 50% until both sides reach a final agreement on the “quota system,” and negotiations on this matter are still ongoing.

The EU has temporarily extended the suspension of retaliatory measures (until August) to await the outcome of the negotiations.

The EU steel industry association has warned that if the issue is not resolved, approximately 3.8 million tons of steel exports to the US could be completely blocked, which could severely impact the already oversupplied EU steel market, especially in the face of Chinese capacity dumping.

What does this mean for the stock market?

European steel companies are most affected

Stocks like ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp are under significant pressure: export channels to the US have been almost completely cut off.

They are also facing triple pressure: high energy costs, weak domestic demand, and the impact of low-priced Chinese steel.

This could be positive for US steel companies and industrial stocks

US domestic steel manufacturers will benefit from reduced European competition.

Some US industrial companies reliant on steel components (such as automotive and construction machinery) may be indirectly affected, depending on whether raw material costs rise.

Impact on the overall market

This agreement has somewhat alleviated fears of an escalating trade war, which is generally positive for the overall market.

However, the steel issue remains an “unresolved mystery,” which will drag down the performance of related sectors in the short term and become an invisible factor in market volatility.

Which stocks should be watched?

Investment strategy    Underlying logic

Short EU steel stocks    Export restrictions + excess capacity + high costs, significant fundamental pressure

Long U.S. steel or domestic auto stocks    Benefit from trade protection and potential price increases

Watch industrial stocks    Monitor whether supply chain costs change due to steel price fluctuations

 Final thoughts:

This trade agreement is a “double-edged sword”: it alleviates overall tariff concerns, but the steel sector is singled out to continue facing pressure. Before the 50% tariff is lifted, European steel manufacturers may continue to contract, while U.S. manufacturers may benefit from structural advantages.

The key focus moving forward is the “quota negotiations”; once the results are announced, the market will immediately reprice.

Have any of you already invested in steel or materials stocks? How do you view the future market outlook? How should one position ahead of the quota scheme announcement?",2025-08-01,0.7586,Positive,"['EU', 'US', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'US', 'EU', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'EU']"

* Trump granted Mexico, the US's largest trading partner, a 90-day reprieve on higher tariffs, saying he would extend the country's current tariff rates to allow for more time for negotiations.

* The US agreed to a trade deal South Korea on Wednesday. The South Korea agreement includes a 15% tariff rate on imports from the country, while the US will not be charged a tariff on its exports, Trump said.

* Trump imposed 50% tariffs on semi-finished copper products starting Aug. 1, but he stopped short of applying the duties to copper scrap and input materials, sending copper (HG=F) futures plunging throughout the week.

* The president signed an order to end the de minimis exemption on low-value imports under $800, thereby applying tariffs from Aug. 29.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Reddit shares jump as much as 10% on second-quarter sales and guidance beat,1mec34j,Puginator,2025-07-31 20:11:24,773,0.94,263,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mec34j/reddit_shares_jump_as_much_as_10_on_secondquarter/,"Reddit shares jumped much as 10% after the company reported second-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat on sales and guidance.

Here’s how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 45 cents vs. 19 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $500 million vs. $426 million expected

Reddit’s sales grew 78% year-over-year in the second quarter and was 17% above consensus estimates, representing the biggest beat in its short history as a public company. Net income came in at $89 million in the second quarter, compared with a net loss of $10 million in the second quarter of last year due to costs associated with its IPO.

The company said third-quarter revenue will be in the range of $535 million to $545 million, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $473 million.

Reddit said global daily active users for the quarter grew 21% year-over-year to 110.4 million, ahead of analyst estimates of 109 million.

The company said that second-quarter global average revenue per user was $4.53, topping analyst estimates of $3.90.

Reddit’s second-quarter sales in the U.S. were $409 million, ahead of StreetAccount estimates of $335 million. International revenue was $91 million in the quarter, compared with $89 million that StreetAccount projected.

Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter is projected to be in between $185 million to $195 million, ahead of StreetAccount’s estimates of $160 million.

Reddit’s “other revenue,” which includes the company’s data licensing business, jumped 24% year-over-year to $35 million.

The company’s second-quarter global logged-in DAUq rose 17% year over year to 49.3 million, while its global logged-out DAUq jumped 24% to 61.1 million.

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a letter to shareholders that the company’s AI-powered Reddit Answers tool, which debuted in December, now has 6 million weekly users, up from 1 million last quarter. Reddit Answers will expand globally and the company will be “integrating it more deeply into the core search experience, and making search a central feature across Reddit,” Huffman wrote in the letter. Huffman did not specify when exactly Reddit Answers will expand.

“Recently, we celebrated Reddit’s 20th year, and I’ve never been more excited about our business and potential than I am today,” Huffman wrote. “The internet is evolving, and our role as a community-powered platform for human connection is only becoming more critical.”

Huffman said that in order to focus on the “most pressing needs,” Reddit is “deprioritizing a few initiatives,” including its “work on the user economy.” Reddit’s initial 2024 IPO prospectus detailed the company’s efforts to build a user economy business, which could include games and online marketplaces akin to Roblox and Facebook Marketplace.

I get that the indexes hold VIX futures, for example, the UVIX currently holds August and September VIX futures, but isn't it good for them if the VIX spot price is moving up?

"$FIG is indicating $95-100, per CNBC",1me69dm,WinningWatchlist,2025-07-31 16:29:46,334,0.95,277,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1me69dm/fig_is_indicating_95100_per_cnbc/,"That values it at \~$59B,  at $100/share, and implies close to $40B overvaluation. The article below has stale numbers but wanted to include for context.

>The indications, which are signals from market makers of the level where trading may begin, imply as much as a 112% gain above the IPO price of $33 apiece. The shares were marketed for $30 to $32 per share, after the company increased the range earlier in the week.

>The company sold 12.47 million shares in the IPO, which priced Tuesday, while investors including Index Ventures, Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins sold 24.46 million shares.

>The IPO pricing gives Figma a market value of $16.1 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. Accounting for employee stock options and restricted stock units, the company has a fully diluted value of roughly $18.5 billion.

>Including restricted stock units for Chief Executive Officer Dylan Field, which are subject to vesting conditions, the fully diluted value would rise above $19 billion.

>The figure is approaching the $20 billion valuation Figma would have fetched in a planned sale to Adobe Inc. that fell apart in 2023.

>The shares offered in Figma’s IPO were approaching 40 times oversubscribed, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, in a sign of robust demand for the first sizable software offering in the US since SailPoint Inc.’s debut in February.

>Figma is used to design web and mobile application interfaces. It has expanded its suite of products in an attempt to be more useful for software development and general workplace collaboration.

>Like many software firms, Figma charges clients based on the number of users and the kind of seat those users have. It added Dev Mode to the platform in 2023 to enable closer collaboration with developers, and has more recently incorporated AI technology into many of its own tools. This year it introduced Figma Make, an AI-based product that lets the user turn prompts into functional prototypes.

>Now that the company is public, “we have to continue to sprint, to push hard, and we can’t let the public markets distract us,” Field said in an interview.

>Going public allows Figma to have a big brand moment which centers the importance of design, Field said. “This is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it.”

>The company is growing quickly, with a 46% year on year increase in first-quarter revenue.

>A key question for Figma’s long-term success is whether it can become a tool used pervasively used by office workers beyond designers. The company’s suite of tools is seeing strong adoption by software developers, product managers, and marketers, said Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia Capital and a member of Figma’s board.

>Sequoia, one of the most storied Silicon Valley venture firms, first invested in Figma in 2019. Around this time, companies were beginning to adopt Figma’s product en masse, Reed said.

>The use of AI-focused software creation apps which are potential competitors to Figma, such as Lovable and Bolt, has rapidly increased this year. Weaving AI features through Figma is a top priority, Field said. “We have so much room to explore how we can make great AI products and experiences.”

>**IPO Volume Climbs**

>The IPO has lifted the volume of first-time share sales on US exchanges above last year’s pace. There has been more than $21 billion worth of US first-time share sales in the year to date, excluding financial vehicles such as blank-check companies, just behind the $20.2 billion raised in the same period in 2024, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

>Demand for Figma’s IPO was likely helped by an order-taking process similar to an auction. Prospective investors in Figma’s offering were asked to precisely state the number of shares they wish to buy and at what price, a person familiar with the matter has said.

>Field will continue to control the company with 74.1% of the votes after the IPO through his holdings of Class B shares that have 15 votes each, the filings show.

>The CEO and fellow Brown University student Evan Wallace started Figma in 2012. Field attended Brown for two and a half years before accepting a Thiel Fellowship, the Peter Thiel-backed program that provides funding to young entrepreneurs, provided they drop out of school. Figma was widely embraced by designers who warmed to its browser-based interface, replacing previous methods of collaboration involving sharing files individually.

>Figma had net income of $44.9 million and revenue of $228 million in the three-month period ended March 31, according to its filings. It reported revenue growth in 2024, though rising operating expenses contributed to a net loss of $732 million for the year.

>Adobe, a maker of software for creative professionals, walked away from the deal to buy Figma following clashes with regulators. It paid a $1 billion termination fee.

>The offering was led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Allen & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The company’s stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FIG.

Absolutely everything you need to know about AMZN earnings today,1me5q6m,IntelligentDroplet,2025-07-31 16:09:49,121,0.91,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1me5q6m/absolutely_everything_you_need_to_know_about_amzn/,"Okay guys, so Amazon is set to release its Q2 earnings after the market closes today with an analyst call at 5 pm. This is gonna be a big one. Did anyone catch META yesterday? Fuck. 

For Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. 

**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**

Analysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. 

Revenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  

Operating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  

These projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical ""beat and raise"" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.

**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**

Amazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  

1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  

AWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.

2) Advertising Revenue  

Advertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.

3) Prime Membership  

Prime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.

4) Operational Efficiency  

Amazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.

5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  

Amazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.

**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**

UBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the ""most coiled"" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated ""outperform"" or ""buy"" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). 

**External Factors and Market Context**

Several external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  

Consider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.

Also, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  

And finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.

**Potential Catalysts**

I'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  


**Comparisons**

Microsoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.

**So what to do?**

Amazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about ±8% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. 

Next week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.",2025-07-31,0.9997,Positive,"['META', 'EPS', 'AWS', 'AI', 'UBS', 'GF', 'AMZN', 'EPS', 'EPS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AWS', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'UBS', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AI', 'UBS', 'MSFT', 'AWS', 'AWS', 'AI', 'AMZN', 'PLTR', 'AMD']"

He said recent conflicts show that autonomous air vehicles will be needed to win. Small drones were just the start *“big vehicles are coming.”* And Archer wants in. Western defense strategy is shifting and eVTOLs might be the next play

Also dropped that Trump’s AAM order was a game changer. Bipartisan support, federal attention this sector has unlocked a cheat code

Meanwhile $ACHR still chilling around midrange. Market sleeping like usual. But if you’ve been loading since April/May, you're already up. And if you know where this is headed? You’re probably still buying.

Civil aviation will take time. Defense might hit way sooner. And nobody’s pricing that in yet.

Nvidia’s first-mover advantage is real but AMD is now ready to capture a significant share of the AI GPU market,1me1y8x,aemsi99,2025-07-31 13:43:32,42,0.77,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1me1y8x/nvidias_firstmover_advantage_is_real_but_amd_is/,"I think that AMD's release of the MI350 series of GPUs will give them a significant presence in the market for the following main reasons. First of all, the performance metrics I mentioned earlier put it on par with Nvidia in terms of hardware. Considering Nvidia's staggering GPU margins, AMD could offer a similar product at a much lower price to grab market share. In fact, there are reports that AMD has plans to raise prices, which one would guess indicates strong demand for its MI350 series.



While data center expansions may not have been worth it for developers in the past, hundreds of billions of dollars are currently being poured into GPUs for AI. Saving even a fraction of that would incentivize companies and their developers to use AMD's open-source ROCm platform instead of CUDA. in short, the GPU market is much larger than it used to be due to the demand for AI, and that changes the economics. In the past, it may not have been worth a developer's time to add a new server stack, but when building entirely new data centers specifically for AI, it makes sense to figure these things out if you can save even 10%.



Additionally, the AI market needs GPU resources both for training to build models and for inference to apply those models to solve problems in real-world scenarios. In the early days of the AI boom, training required more resources, or at least about half of each. In the future, reasoning resources are expected to grow faster than training resources. Fortunately (or more likely by design), products such as AMD's MI350 excel at inference and are on par with the Blackwell family. Here's how much AMD expects AI usage to continue to grow, with breakthroughs in training and inference",2025-07-31,0.8092,Positive,"['AMD', 'GPU', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AI', 'AMD', 'CUDA', 'GPU', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'GPU', 'AI', 'AMD', 'AMD', 'AI']"
"Trump lashed out at Powell again, but this time he might not be wrong? $SPY $QQQ $TLT",1me1eux,mattishannon,2025-07-31 13:21:14,0,0.16,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1me1eux/trump_lashed_out_at_powell_again_but_this_time_he/,"Trump recently took to Truth Social to once again criticize Jerome Powell, calling him “too late,” “too aggressive,” “too stupid,” and “too political,” and accusing him of costing the U.S. “trillions.” He even criticized the renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters as “the most corrupt construction project in history.”

It sounds like Trump is losing his mind, but the key point is that he might actually be right this time.

Current Market Context July 31, 2025  

Federal Funds Rate: Still at 5.25%, with Powell maintaining a hawkish stance this month.  

June CPI YoY: 3.6%, lower than last month's 3.9% but still above the 2% target.  

Core PCE Data (just released): Held steady at 3.3%.

Labor Market: Last week’s nonfarm payrolls data slowed, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.2%.  

10-Year Treasury Yield: Back up to 4.5%, with $TLT getting hammered again.  

S&P/Nasdaq: Rebounded slightly after earnings season, but volatility is rising again as the market begins to digest the reality of “long-term high interest rates.”  

Is Powell really “too late” again?

To be honest, Powell has always been chasing the market, never leading it:  

2021: “Inflation is temporary” backfired.  

2022-2023: Initiated the fastest pace of rate hikes in 40 years.

2024: He paused rate hikes early, only for inflation to return.

2025: Now we're in a mild “stagflation” state, stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Trump may be harsh with his words, but the nickname “Too Late” isn't entirely undeserved. Powell always reacts after the fact, and the market has grown tired of his pace.

As for what he meant by “renovation corruption”?

Many speculate he's referring to the Federal Reserve headquarters (Marriner Eccles Building) renovation project, which has a budget exceeding $2 billion and has been significantly delayed, becoming a political joke for months.

So what should be done now?

The market is currently in a state of wait-and-see: bulls want to see rate cuts; bears believe inflation hasn't been resolved; Trump has already shifted the blame onto Powell. If Powell cuts rates too early, inflation could spike again; if he waits too long, the economy could hard-land.

Trump's statements may be bold, but they're not entirely irrational.  

Powell has indeed been slow to act, and now everyone is paying the price for his “lagging response.”  

With high interest rates and sticky inflation, $SPY and $QQQ are also waiting for a clear direction.

I am an investor with moderate experience, with mixed results with IPOs.

I rarely get any premarket “requested” shares, so often buy on IPO day on the secondary market.  Often the shares pop out of the gate, sometimes to a price they never achieve again due to flippers.  I got left holding the bag so to speak buying an ipo after the pop and it plummets.  Sometimes not.  I don’t flip shares, I am a medium to long term investor. I have made the mistake twice with ipos i believe in by buying as soon as they drop.  And yet logic would say if you believe in a stock to buy it the minute you can.  Any advice?

BATS (BATS.L) said it expects annual revenue growth to come in at the top end of its forecast range.


The maker of Lucky Strike and Dunhill cigarettes said revenue in the U.S., which makes up about 44% of total sales, grew 3.7% at constant currency, with Velo, its nicotine pouches, helping sales of its new category products grow 3.9%.


Its smokeless products, which include Velo, Vuse Ultra premium vapour, and glo Hilo heated tobacco, make up more than 18% of total revenue.
BAT and peers such as Philip Morris (PM.N), Imperial Brands (IMB.L), and Altria (MO.N) are trying to capture a bigger share of the vapes, tobacco heating product and oral nicotine pouches market as sales drop in traditional tobacco products.


While most of BAT's products sold in the U.S. are produced locally, its Vuse vape devices are made in Indonesia, now subject to a 19% tariff.


CEO Tadeu Marroco said at a news briefing that BAT had front-loaded some stock to mitigate this in the short-term, but would look to absorb most of the tariff via its profit margin, adding that U.S.-produced liquids were a bigger part of its business.


BAT would also be exposed to higher costs via items such as packaging material, he said, though the impact of this was ""manageable"" and the company was watching how consumers would be affected by widespread tariff changes for the rest of the year.


It reported adjusted diluted earnings of 162 pence per share for the six months to June 30, compared with 159.4 pence a year ago, and a company-compiled consensus estimate of 154.8 pence.


The company said it was on track to achieve its 2025 financial forecast, with annual sales growth likely at the upper end of its 1%-2% forecast range.

While Samsung’s second-quarter operating profit beat its own forecast of around 4.6 trillion won, it was a steep drop from the 10.44 trillion won recorded in the same period last year.

The South Korean technology giant posted a quarterly revenue of 74.6 trillion won, up slightly from 74.07 trillion won a year earlier and beating its forecast of 74 trillion won.

* **Revenue**: 74.6 trillion won ($53.5 billion) vs. 74.43 trillion won 
* **Operating profit:** 4.7 trillion won vs. 5.33 trillion won

Shares of Samsung fell by as much as 1.79% in early trading.

Notably, its Device Solutions division, which encompasses its memory chip, semiconductor design and foundry business units, recorded a 93.8% drop in operating profit year over year.

Samsung Electronics’ chip business posted an operating profit of 400 billion won in the second quarter, plunging from 6.45 trillion won in the same period last year. Chip revenue fell to 27.9 trillion won, from 28.56 trillion won last year.

Following a better-than-expected earnings report on Wednesday, Microsoft shares jumped 8%, lifting the software giant’s market cap to about $4.1 trillion. Should the rally stick on Thursday, Microsoft would join chipmaker Nvidia, which hit $4 trillion for the first time earlier this month.

Microsoft reported 18% revenue growth, its fastest rate of expansion in over three years, driven by its Azure cloud computing business. Microsoft disclosed Azure revenue in dollars for the first time, and said sales from Azure and other cloud services exceeded $75 billion in fiscal 2025, up 34% from the prior year.

As of the close on Wednesday, Microsoft shares were up 22% for the year, topping the S&P 500′s 8% gain. Microsoft hit a record close of $513.71 on July 25. The stock is above $553 in extended trading.

Nvidia and Microsoft, two of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, have zoomed past Apple on the market cap leaderboard. Apple is third at about $3.2 trillion, with its stock having fallen 17% this year as investors worry that the iPhone maker is getting left behind in AI. Apple reports quarterly results after the bell on Thursday.

Among tech’s megacaps, Nvidia has been the best performer in 2025, up 33%. The chipmaker’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of the large language models being developed by Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Meta and others, and they’re filling up data centers being built by those same companies.

Nvidia is scheduled to report results in late August.

The arrangement, announced shortly after Trump met with Korean officials at the White House, came during a blizzard of trade policy announcements ahead of a self-imposed August 1 deadline.

That is when Trump has promised higher tariffs will kick in on U.S. imports from a range of countries. Imports from South Korea, a powerhouse exporter of computer chips, cars and steel, faced a 25% rate.

""I am pleased to announce that the United States of America has agreed to a Full and Complete Trade Deal with the Republic of Korea,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

The negotiations were an early test for South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June after a snap election. He said the deal had eliminated uncertainty in the export environment and set U.S. tariffs lower than or at the same level as major competitors.

""We have crossed a big hurdle,"" Lee said in a post on Facebook. Trump said Lee would visit the White House ""within the next two weeks"" for his first meeting with the U.S. president.

Trump said South Korea had agreed to invest $350 billion in the United States in projects selected by Trump and to purchase $100 billion of liquefied natural gas and other energy products, the U.S. president said. Both steps have been major priorities for Trump, a Republican, in other trade deals.

If U.S.-backed stablecoins, digital assets that are backed by the dollar, gain traction for use in the EU, the effect could be similar to the impact of the U.S. dollar on developing economies, Jürgen Schaaf said in a blog post on Monday. In particular, they have made it harder for policymakers to set interest rates and control money supply.


""This encroachment, though gradual, could echo patterns observed in dollarised economies, especially if users seek perceived safety or yield advantages that are not available in euro-denominated instruments,"" Schaaf said.

The biggest stablecoins are Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, which together make up more than 80% of the total stablecoin market cap, which climbed to $271.8 billion following the signing into law of a U.S. stablecoin act on July 19.

Schaaf described the U.S. law as similar to the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, but more lenient in some areas. The implementation of the act could result in the stablecoin market growing to $2 trillion by the end of 2028, investment bank Standard Chartered said in April.

This weekend, protesters in Los Angeles found a new destination: Musk’s new 24-hour Tesla Diner in the Hollywood area.

Joel Lava, who has helped organize “Tesla Takedown” demonstrations and has spearheaded protests at the diner, believes that protests could continue throughout the summer and that the buzz around the new restaurant will soon die down.

“(Customers are) waiting 11 hours so they can have Tesla-brand burgers and fries,” Lava told CNN. “This is the world’s most renowned anti-trans advocate who just opened a diner in West Hollywood. The community is not very supportive of Elon.”

Lava estimates as many as 75 demonstrators joined the diner protest on Saturday. He said organizers began planning protests for this weekend after the diner abruptly opened on Monday.

“Our main message is Tesla funds fascism. Elon Musk, via DOGE, has destroyed our government agencies and people’s jobs, and people are dying around the world because of him,” Lava said.

Investors will closely monitor signs of growth in ad inventory, potential growth from its partnership with Amazon, and subscription growth.

Analysts expect Roku to report a loss of $0.16 per share and revenue of $1.07 billion, representing a 10% increase from last year.

Wedbush analysts anticipate that Roku will benefit from its DSP partnerships, high-quality inventory, improved targeting, sports-related advertising, and the variety of price points available on its platform.

Analysts predict that Roku's platform revenue will grow by 14% year-over-year to $940 million, in line with expectations.

Analysts stated, “Nevertheless, given Roku's increasingly diversified business model, expanding advertising opportunities, and achievable parameters across its entire operational model, we believe its guidance still has upside potential.”

Wedbush expects Roku to maintain its 2025 EBITDA guidance and 2026 positive operating income target, similar to the first quarter.

Over the past three months, earnings per share forecasts have been lowered four times, revenue forecasts have been raised twice, and revenue forecasts have been lowered 21 times.

Bank of America analysts recently raised their target price for Roku (ROKU) and reiterated their bullish rating, citing improved macroeconomic sentiment and the favorable impact of its recently announced partnership with Amazon (AMZN).

They noted that the partnership with Amazon “once again demonstrates Roku's intention to become more flexible and further drive interoperability within its platform.”

It seems like I’m going to have the option of getting $15/share for them (although it seems like maybe less depending on how many other people take that offer) or exchanging for shares in the new company. 

What would you do?

Indian Stock Market Eyes Gap-Down Opening After Donald Trump Imposes 25% Tariff On India,1md801g,girlikeapearl_,2025-07-30 14:25:45,71,0.82,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1md801g/indian_stock_market_eyes_gapdown_opening_after/,"The Indian stock market awaits a gap-down opening on Thursday, July 30, after US President Donald Trump announced a supersized 25% tariff rate on India for trade. Gift Nifty was trading around 24,712 level, down nearly 150 points, a discount of nearly 140 points from the Nifty futures’ previous close, indicating a muted start for the Indian stock market indices.

GIFT Nifty operates in two trading sessions. The first session runs from 6:30 a.m. to 3:40 p.m. IST. The second session begins at 4:35 p.m. and continues until 2:45 a.m. the following day.

""The stock market may open tomorrow with a knee-jerk reaction after the latest US tariff announcement of 25%. However, it remains to be seen if the trade deal gets postponed upon negotiations to decide when the tariff will kick in. Going by the recent past, the Trump administration is notorious to be playing its trade tactics, bringing in more twists and turns for trading partners,"" said Kranthi Bathini, Equity strategist, WealthMills Securities Pvt Ltd.

 Apart from the 25% tariff rate, Trump also said that India will pay a tariff of 25% from Aug. 1 in a post on Truth Social. He also added that India will pay a penalty for its purchases of Russian military equipment and Russian energy. The announcement comes after Trump on Tuesday said that the rate of tariff to be levied against Indian imports had not been finalised yet.

""Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country (sic),"" Trump said in his post on Truth Social. In another post on the social media platform, Trump added that US have a massive trade deficit with India.

EURUSD falls to lowest since early July What does this mean for equities and macro?,1md6cp4,Khazash,2025-07-30 13:17:13,3,0.54,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1md6cp4/eurusd_falls_to_lowest_since_early_july_what_does/,"With the recent macro situation, this could have a knock-on effect on equities and risk assets:

This morning, the EURUSD fell to its lowest since early July and is currently hovering around 1.0800. That's not a small drop, and a few days ago we were near the top of 1.09.

There are probably a few reasons at the heart of this decline: 

US economic data was too strong 

Q2 GDP was revised upwards to 2.8% (previously 2.3%).

Core PCE (the Fed's most watched inflation indicator) was higher than expected.

These data strengthened the market's expectations that the Fed will “keep interest rates high for longer” and made the dollar stronger.

ECB releases dovish signals 

Eurozone inflation data showed some easing.

Germany's latest PMI data is very weak, recession fears are rising again.

Some ECB officials are starting to sound cautious, and the market expects that rate cuts could start in early 2026 (and there are even suggestions that they could be possible by the end of 2025).

Safe-haven capital is pouring into the dollar 

Geopolitical situations are heating up (e.g. Ukraine, global trade tensions), allowing the dollar to attract a lot of capital as a safe-haven asset.

Meanwhile, U.S. bond yields remain firm 10-year U.S. bonds are close to 4.3%.

What does this mean for the markets?

Large tech stocks and those companies that are heavily influenced by the dollar (e.g., $AAPL, $MSFT, $META) could be under pressure, especially since a good portion of their revenue comes from Europe.

Multinationals (e.g., $PG, $KO, $JNJ) could take a loss in Q3 earnings due to exchange rate losses.

Eurozone stocks (which can be followed via the $EZU or $FEZ ETFs) could be pressured by economic weakness, but a weak euro favors German exporters, such as automakers.

Dollar-denominated commodities (e.g., gold, crude oil) could come under pressure in the short term due to a stronger dollar, unless macro risks push up safe-haven demand, such as gold.

My take?

Short-term weakness in the euro is justified, but the next thing to watch is whether US inflation continues to “stick”, and the Fed's attitude at its annual meeting in Jackson Hole at the end of August. If Powell is hawkish again, we could see EUR/USD fall to 1.07 or even 1.06.

Is anyone hedging their exchange rate risk with forex manipulation, long DXY (dollar index) options, or in company earnings reports?

Tesla signs $4.3B battery deal with LG  finally moving away from China for LFPs?,1md5o45,farmacy25,2025-07-30 12:47:02,2,0.54,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1md5o45/tesla_signs_43b_battery_deal_with_lg_finally/,"Tesla just signed a $4.3B deal with LG Energy Solution for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries  not for cars, but for energy storage systems (ESS). What’s interesting is that the batteries will come from LG’s Michigan factory, not China.

This looks like a clear move to reduce China dependence, especially after Tesla’s CFO said earlier this year that tariffs on Chinese batteries were heavily impacting their energy business. LG is currently one of the only players actually producing LFPs in the U.S., while Samsung SDI and SK On are still on the sidelines.

The deal runs from 2027 to 2030, with options to extend for another 7 years and increase volume if needed.

Tesla’s energy business is still just over 10% of revenue, but it’s been growing quickly while EV sales have been slowing. Energy storage demand is getting a major boost from AI/data centers and grid needs.

Makes me wonder  is energy going to be a serious part of Tesla’s long-term story, or is it still just a side hustle? And for LGES, is this a first-mover advantage that gives them a real edge in the U.S. LFP market?

Also: Is this just Tesla being smart and managing geopolitical risk, or are they being forced to pay more just to get around tariffs?

Separately, Tesla also signed a $16.5B chip supply deal with Samsung, also U.S.-based. Seems like a clear trend of Tesla diversifying its supply chain toward the U.S. and South Korea.

"U.S. economy grew at a 3% rate in Q2, a better-than-expected pace even as Trump’s tariffs hit",1md5j8l,_hiddenscout,2025-07-30 12:40:46,682,0.9,473,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1md5j8l/us_economy_grew_at_a_3_rate_in_q2_a/,"The U.S. economy grew at a much better than expected pace in the second quarter, powered by a turnaround in the trade balance and renewed consumer strength, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.

Gross domestic product, a sum of goods and services activity across the sprawling U.S. economy, jumped 3% for the April-through-June period, according to figures adjusted for seasonality and inflation.

That topped the Dow Jones estimate for 2.3% and helped reverse a decline of 0.5% for the first quarter that came largely due to a huge drop in imports, which subtract from the total, as well as a weak consumer spending amid tariff concerns.

The period reported Wednesday includes President Donald Trump’s April 2 “liberation day” tariff announcement. Imports had jumped in the first quarters as companies sought to get ahead of the announcement.

Over the past three months, Trump has been engaged in multiple rounds of saber rattling and often intense negotiations with U.S. trading partners that have jangled nerves but nonetheless coincided with a subdued but solid pace of economic growth.

It is the only Fintech bank that combines a Charter bank, a Financial technology payment processing platform, and Cyberbank Core capabilities. It is not here to play the catch-up game, and acquisitions are the most efficient and fastest way to get crucial items on board. It'll take years to build them in-house if it is even possible. The first to dominate all the functions/products will be the winner, and the winner takes most. Acquisitions are needed for SoFi to become a top 10 financial institution as part of the CEO's goal.

These are the 6 known acquisitions so far:

April 3, 2023 Wyndham Capital Mortgage Undisclosed

February 22, 2022 Technisys Undisclosed

March 9, 2021 Golden Pacific Bank $22.3M

April 21, 2020 8 Securities Undisclosed

April 7, 2020 Galileo $1.2B

February 1, 2017 Zenbanx \~$100M

\* Wyndham Capital Mortgage for Online Home Mortgages.

\* Techynisys for Cyberbank Core.

\* Golden Pacific Bank for Bank Charter.

\* SoFi bought Hong Kong and Tokyo-based consumer stock trading app 8 Securities. SoFi Hong Kong became the only brokerage service to offer stock trading of more than 15,000 US and Hong Kong stocks, as well as exchange-traded funds, at the time.

\* Galileo for Financial technology payment processing.

\* Zenbanx was acquired to offer Mobile Banking Accounts.

The probable reason for yesterday's news about the public offering of common stock worth $1.5B is for another acquisition (possibly Crypto related), especially since SoFi had $2.12 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q2. SoFi has demonstrated strong revenue growth and maintains a healthy gross profit margin.

This might slow momentum temporarily unless they announce plans for the use of that $1.5 billion soon. However, it should benefit the stock in the long run.

The CEO is motivated to reach a $45 (90-day average) target PBC (Performance-Based Compensation) by June 1, 2026, to earn over $289 million in SBC. The $1.5 billion would erase yesterday's stock gains and a bit more, but it’s a price worth paying for possible crucial expansion.

Is Oklo/SMR/TerraPower the next NVDA/AMD/Intel?,1mcranr,Brilliant-Repeat-178,2025-07-29 23:41:39,0,0.5,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mcranr/is_oklosmrterrapower_the_next_nvdaamdintel/,"
Ok so here’s how I’m seeing it.
Everyone’s focused on $NVDA, $AMD, $INTC, but they’re just one piece of the whole puzzle. Here’s how I see it: AI needs constant computational and electrical power. Not just for the data centers and the fabs that make the chips, but the chips themselves burn power 24/7. The more models scale, the more energy they eat. That power has to come from somewhere. Big tech ceos are already talking about potential future power shortages if we dont come up with something better than what we have rn
So here’s how I’m thinking about it:
We started with AI companies throwing money at chip companies →chip companies throwing money at fabs like TSMC →fabs and AI centers pulling insane amounts of power off the grid →and now we’re about to see power companies (especially nuclear) get flooded with cash →and that means the uranium miners feeding those reactors are next in line.
This is how i see the chain:
AI companies → NVDA / AMD / INTC → TSMC / Samsung → SMRs like Oklo / SMR / TerraPower → uranium miners like UUUU / NXE / CCJ.
Every stage up the chain got paid. The last ones left to run are nuclear and uranium.
I think we’re about to see a repeat of the same pattern within the next few years as we experience energy shortage. Just like how NVDA and AMD dominated chips, I think a couple players will dominate nuclear. Right now we’ve got:
* Oklo (backed by Sam Altman, just IPO’d $10.5B)
* NuScale / SMR (~$6.8B)
* TerraPower (still private but Gates-backed and getting a ton of attention)
That’s probably the big 3. Others will show up, but like everything else, a couple names are going to take 80% of the market and leave everyone else behind.
Same goes for uranium. CCJ is the king, but NXE and UUUU are getting attention. Supply is tight, and if nuclear demand explodes, miners get squeezed upward just like GPU demand squeezed NVDA.
So yeah, are Oklo / SMR / TerraPower are the next NVDA / AMD / INTC  just further up the chain? The ones getting paid by the ones getting paid.
I’m looking at LEAP calls and they are not that expensive while they’re still under the radar. It’s the last piece of the AI/infrastructure puzzle that hasn’t run yet.

Spotify drops 11% for worst day in two years on weak guidance,1mcm7th,Puginator,2025-07-29 20:15:04,646,0.97,132,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mcm7th/spotify_drops_11_for_worst_day_in_two_years_on/,"Spotify shares dropped more than 11% Tuesday for their worst day since July 2023 after the music streaming service fell short of Wall Street’s expectations and posted weak guidance for the current quarter.

Here’s how the company did versus LSEG estimates:

* **Loss:** Loss of .42 euros vs. earnings of 1.90 euros per share expected
* **Revenue:** 4.19 billion euros vs. 4.26 billion expected

The Swedish platform’s revenues rose 10% from about 3.81 billion euros in the year-ago period. The company posted a net loss of 86 million euros, or a loss of .42 euros per share, down from net income of 225 million euros, or 1.10 euros per share a year ago.

Spotify said that higher personnel, marketing and professional services costs and 115 million euros worth of what it called social charges contributed to the results.

Third-quarter guidance came up short of Wall Street’s forecast.

The company expects revenues to reach 4.2 billion euros, compared to a 4.47 billion euro estimate from StreetAccount. Spotify said the forecast accounts for a 490-basis-point headwind due to foreign exchange rates.

Monthly active users on the platform jumped 11% to 696 million, while paying subscribers rose 12% from a year ago to 276 million. Ad-tier subscribers account for over 60% of Spotify’s monthly users.

For the current quarter, Spotify said it expects to reach 710 million monthly active users, with 14 million net adds. The company expects 5 million net new premium subscribers in the third quarter to reach 281 million subscriptions.

Spotify’s advertising-supported revenues declined about 1% to 453 million euros from 456 million euros a year ago. The company said it sees promise in its advertising stack and demand given its strong user base and will focus on adoption and new tools in the second half. Some areas of opportunity include business and automated ads.

“It’s really an execution challenge, not a problem with the strategy,” said CEO Daniel Ek during an earnings call. “While I’m unhappy with where we are today, I remain confident in the ambitions we laid out for this business, and we’re working quickly to ensure we’re on the right path.”

Ek said the company is seeing some “promising signs” in its programmatic business.

Multiple news outlets reported this week that Doordash had poached the company’s advertising head as chief revenue officer.

During the period, Spotify said it rolled out a request feature for its artificial intelligence DJ. The company said engagement with its AI DJ has roughly doubled over the last year. Its audiobooks feature expanded to four new countries during the quarter, and listening hours jumped 35% in the U.S., U.K. and Australia.

Earlier this year, an indie rock band on the platform known as Velvet Sundown gained media attention after it quickly captured over a million new listeners and raised questions over artificial intelligence use in music creation. The “band” was later confirmed to be mainly AI-generated after widespread speculation.

In 2024, Spotify posted its first full year of profitability as it slashed costs and hiked prices. Over the years, the company has prioritized subscriber gains and invested beyond music in podcasts and audiobooks. Apple Music remains one of its top competitors.

Spotify said it ended the quarter with more than 7,300 full-time employees and upped its share repurchase program by $1 billion. Shares are up more than 40% this year.

Here’s what the company reported for the quarter ended June 29 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: 50 cents adjusted, it was not immediately clear if it was comparable to the 65 cents expected
* Revenue: $9.5 billion vs. $9.31 billion expected

Excluding certain items, the company earned 50 cents per share. A discrete tax item and a one-time investment hosting the company’s three-day event for U.S. store managers weighed on the company’s earnings per share by 11 cents.

Net sales rose 4% to $9.5 billion. But global same-store sales declined 2%, a steeper drop than estimates of a 1.3% decrease, according to StreetAccount.

However, Starbucks’ North American cafes performed better than expected. The chain’s North American same-store sales fell 2%, a smaller decline than the 2.5% projected by Wall Street, according to StreetAccount.

And in China, the company’s second-largest market, Starbucks reported same-store sales growth of 2% for the quarter.

The AI fever continues driving the market to record highs.

After blowing through $60 billion on the Metaverse, Zuckerberg is now racing to lead the charge for super intelligence and infinite gains.

While I'm somewhat skeptical about this strategy of hiring a bunch of rockstar researchers who have never worked together and expecting them to perform miracles, we all have to admire Zuck's boldness.

But my point here is about whether Wall Street truly understands the magnitude of spending that Meta is committing to, and how this will affect financial results in the coming months and years.

I can't think of any similar example other than Meta itself between 2019 and 2022 with the Metaverse. And even this seems to be an order of magnitude larger.

Perhaps a similar positive example would be Microsoft's pivot to the Cloud in 2012. But in that situation, there was only one major competitor (AWS).

To wrap up: I expect that tomorrow we'll see much stronger movements in companies like Nvidia, AMD, Dell, IBM on the upside and Google and Oracle on the downside.

Microsoft and OpenAI are in talks to continue working together to use their technology, something that could impact the next phase of the AI industry. Something to watch.

Let's be honest, Microsoft has long invested heavily in OpenAI, and with ChatGPT's integration with their Azure, it's basically become a standard solution for enterprise AI. If this time around, they're renegotiating the partnership or expanding it, it could mean:

Deeper bindings to OpenAI technology

Priority or exclusive access to future GPT releases

A possible new structure for the licensing model

A strategic moat against Google, Meta, and Amazon.

Of course, it could also mean that OpenAI is getting stronger and doesn't want to be completely dependent on Microsoft for dominance.

Would like to hear everyone's thoughts:

Is it good for Microsoft in the long run?

Will it affect OpenAI's independence or future valuation?

This has caused the stock to surge afterhours yesterday. Interestingly, the stock was worth $35 before the ELEVIDYS news even happened, but we haven't resurged. So I'm a little wary of this because we haven't been going back all the way. Worth watching at the open. 

Edit: From a tweet I read, this is because ""FDA backs Sarepta's Elevidys again in ambulatory Duchenne patients but addressed none of the 3 deaths that actually triggered the agency's earlier request for a shipment pause."", so that explains why we're not all the way back yet.

Additionally, the company appointed a new CEO (Maziar Mike Doustdar) Maziar Mike Doustdar as the new CEO, effective August 7. From what I've read online, many people expected the CEO to be an American (because the main market for the weight-loss drugs is America because our obesity rate is so high). But I doubt that's a major factor in affecting stock price. We've essentially bled from 70 ->50 and had a slight bounce intraday, so I'm interested to see if we sell off again at the open/during market hours.

"Spotify stock falls on revenue miss, lackluster guidance",1mc9j9c,TAKINAS_INNOVATION,2025-07-29 12:01:58,178,0.96,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mc9j9c/spotify_stock_falls_on_revenue_miss_lackluster/,"Spotify shares dropped about 4% Tuesday after the music streaming platform fell short of Wall Street’s expectations and posted weak guidance for the current quarter.

Here’s how the company did versus LSEG estimates:

* **Loss:** Loss of .42 euros vs earnings of 1.90 euros per share expected
* **Revenue:** 4.19 billion euros vs. 4.26 billion expected

The Sweden-based music platform’s  revenue rose 10% from about 3.81 billion euros in the year-ago period. The company posted a net loss of 86 million euros, or a loss of .42 euros per share, down from net income of 225 million euros, or 1.10 euros per share a year ago.

Third-quarter guidance came up short of Wall Street’s forecast.

The company expects revenues to reach 4.2 billion euros, compared to a 4.47 billion euro estimate from StreetAccount. Spotify said the forecast accounts for a 490-basis-point headwind due to foreign exchange rates.

  
Monthly active users on the platform jumped 11% to 696 million, while paying subscribers rose 12% from a year ago to 276 million.

For the current quarter, Spotify said it expects to reach 710 million monthly active users, with 14 million net adds. The company expects 5 million net new premium subscribers in the third quarter to reach 281 million subscriptions.

During the period, Spotify said it rolled out a request feature for its artificial intelligence DJ. The company said engagement with the offering has roughly doubled over the last year.

In 2024, Spotify posted its first full year of profitability. Shares are up 57% this year.

**""Our biggest challenge beyond 2025, quite frankly, is what not to do.  There are more opportunities on the table for us than ever before, it feels like we are just getting started,"" as stated by the CEO during the conference call.**

**Noninterest income (low risk) includes fee-based revenue generated primarily through the loan platform business (LPB), referrals, interchange, and brokerage. Has jumped from 37M to 169M in 1 year. Currently, representing 46.6% of SoFi's 363M income for this quarter.**

**44% YOY Growth.**

**Beat the ""Rule of 40"" by 13 consecutive quarters with this quarter at 70.**

Guidance and Outlook Given the strong first half of the year, management is increasing its 2025 guidance.

For the full year 2025, management now expects to deliver adjusted net revenue of approximately $3.375 billion, which is $65 million higher than the top end of the prior guidance range of $3.235 to $3.310 billion. This implies approximately 30% annual growth versus 24% to 27% in our prior guidance. Management expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately $960 million, above prior guidance of $875 to $895 million. This represents an EBITDA margin of 28%. SoFi expects GAAP net income of approximately $370 million, above prior guidance of $320 to $330 million. Lastly, SoFi expects GAAP EPS of approximately $0.31 cents per share, above prior guidance of $0.27 to $0.28 cents per share. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 26% for the remainder of the year.

Management expects growth in tangible book value of approximately $640 million. **Management expects to add at least 3.0 million new members in 2025**, which represents approximately 30% growth from 2024 levels.

Management will further address full-year guidance on the quarterly earnings conference call. Management has not reconciled forward-looking non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. This is because the company cannot predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable efforts the ultimate outcome of certain GAAP components of such reconciliations due to market-related assumptions that are not within our control as well as certain legal or advisory costs, tax costs or other costs that may arise. For these reasons, management is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures.

The **""Rule of 40""** is a financial benchmark to assess a company's financial health and sustainability. It suggests that a healthy SaaS company's combined revenue growth rate and profit margin should be 40% or greater. This rule helps investors and company leaders evaluate whether a company is effectively balancing growth with profitability.",2025-07-29,0.9953,Positive,"['GAAP', 'EPS', 'CEO', 'LPB', 'YOY', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'EPS', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'GAAP', 'GAAP']"

Shareholders of UK fintech Wise vote to move main stock market listing to US,1mbsfnn,coinfanking,2025-07-28 21:07:36,32,0.87,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mbsfnn/shareholders_of_uk_fintech_wise_vote_to_move_main/,"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/28/shareholders-of-uk-fintech-wise-vote-to-move-main-stock-market-listing-to-us

The UK online payments company Wise is to move its main stock market listing to the US after shareholders approved the move.

Investors in Wise, one of the biggest financial technology businesses in the UK with a market value of about £11bn, voted on Monday in favour of a dual listing in the US in an attempt to attract more investors and boost its value.


The vote at the extraordinary general meeting was controversial because it was bound with also agreeing an extension of the company’s “dual-class” structure giving enhanced voting rights to those holding class B shares.

A chief beneficiary of this is the co-founder and chief executive, Kristo Käärmann, with his 18% economic interest in Wise becoming 55%, although his voting power is capped at 50%.

The company has said that moving its main listing would “drive greater awareness of Wise in the US, the biggest market opportunity in the world for our products today, and enabling better access to the world’s deepest and most liquid capital market”.

However, the co-founder Taavet Hinrikus, who has 5.1% of the shares and controls 11.8% of the votes, had publicly disagreed with the “all or nothing” vote.",2025-07-28,0.9922,Positive,"['UK', 'US', 'UK', 'US', 'US']"

EU admits it can’t guarantee $600B promise to Trump. The extra investments pledged under the trade deal would come from private companies.,1mbjonp,DarkPriestScorpius,2025-07-28 15:44:21,645,0.96,132,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mbjonp/eu_admits_it_cant_guarantee_600b_promise_to_trump/,"https://www.politico.eu/article/eus-600bn-us-investment-will-come-exclusively-from-private-sector/

The European Union has admitted it doesn’t have the power to deliver on a promise to invest $600 billion in the United States economy, only hours after making the pledge at landmark trade talks in Scotland.

That’s because the cash would come entirely from private sector investment over which Brussels has no authority, two EU officials said.

On Sunday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen struck a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to avoid an all-out EU-U.S. trade war. The deal included a pledge to invest an extra $600 billion of EU money into the U.S. over the coming years.

But speaking Monday, two senior European Commission officials clarified that money would come exclusively from private European companies, with public investment contributing nothing.

“It is not something that the EU as a public authority can guarantee. It is something which is based on the intentions of the private companies,” said one of the senior Commission officials. The Commission has not said it will introduce any incentives to ensure the private sector meets that $600 billion target, nor given a precise timeframe for the investment.

However, the first official said that the $600 billion figure was ""based on detailed discussions with different business associations and companies in order to see what their investment intentions are.""

Trump had threatened to impose 30 percent tariffs on most EU imports from Aug. 1, but after negotiations Sunday he dropped the figure to 15 percent.

The EU’s $600-billion promise played a key role in facilitating this agreement, but quickly drew criticism that an investment of that size would come at the cost of investment within Europe.

The Commission pointed out that the figure would come from private companies, not European taxpayers, contrasting with Japan’s promise to mobilize $550 billion of both public and private investments in the U.S. as part of a recently agreed trade deal.



But the idea that the private sector can be relied upon to provide that level of investment was met with skepticism.

""This part of the deal is largely performative,"" Nils Redeker from the Jacques Delors Centre think tank told POLITICO. ""[The EU] is not China, right? So nobody can tell private companies how much they invest in the U.S.""

The EU officials said that the estimated $600 billion will add to the EU’s current $2.8 trillion private investments in the U.S. that accounts for approximately 3.4 million jobs.",2025-07-28,0.9035,Positive,"['EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU']"

US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that an agreement with China was “basically” reached, although details remain unclear. His remarks came ahead of high-level talks between China and the US scheduled for Monday in Stockholm, with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Pritzker set to lead the discussions.

Extension of the US-China tariff truce agreement (set to expire in mid-August)

U.S. pressure on China over fentanyl and oil imports from sanctioned countries

Rare earths: China's key bargaining chip; critical for electric vehicles, wind energy, and defense technology

Washington's ongoing restrictions on semiconductors related to artificial intelligence

Meanwhile, the EU has accepted a 15% tariff agreement and committed to investing $600 billion, indicating that Trump's hardline trade policy is escalating once again.

If negotiations fail, new tariffs on China's semiconductor, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries could take effect by the end of the third quarter.

Markets may not react strongly in the short term, but if tariffs are reimposed, this could severely impact chip manufacturers, multinational corporations, and industrial firms with business ties to China.

Geopolitical Alert: Trump Warns Iran Not to Restart Nuclear Program Should We Watch Oil & Gas and Military Stocks?,1mbgfim,pooksy213,2025-07-28 13:38:46,26,0.72,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mbgfim/geopolitical_alert_trump_warns_iran_not_to/,"Trump just spoke out and warned Iran not to restart its nuclear program. While this isn't the first time US-Iran relations have been strained, given his current favorability ratings in the 2024 election, this kind of statement could trigger some reaction in the market - especially in the energy and military sectors.

 Directions to watch: 

Crude Oil (WTI / Brent): oil price volatility could increase if the situation escalates. Iran remains an important player in the Middle East.

Energy stocks (XLE, OXY, XOM, CVX): these targets may react quickly to news changes.

Military stocks (LMT, RTX, NOC): these tend to gain market attention when geopolitical tensions are high.

Gold / Silver: Precious metals may act as a short-term hedge in times of market jitters.

 Macro perspective: 

If tensions continue to escalate, this could cause markets to enter “risk aversion mode”, with short-term flows to safer assets such as the US dollar and gold.

If oil prices rise, it may also affect the market's expectations of inflation.

Open discussion: 

Have you considered geopolitical risk in your current trading strategy?

Has anyone already laid out a position in the energy/military sector?

"Why Redwire Could Be One of the Most Undervalued Plays in Space, Defense, and AI Going Into 2026: $1B+ Is in Sight Sooner Than You Think",1mbfy79,LongTemporary5145,2025-07-28 13:18:37,0,0.41,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mbfy79/why_redwire_could_be_one_of_the_most_undervalued/,"Redwire is quietly assembling the holy trinity of future tech: **Space infrastructure, AI-driven mission systems, and autonomous defense platforms**. After digging through SEC filings, DoD roadmaps, company presentations, earnings calls, RFPs and defense budget line-items, etc. I genuinely believe 2026 will be the turning point, after Edge autonomy is fully integrated and revenues finally break the $1 billion barrier.

**Here’s a breakdown by segment:**

# 1. Core Space & Commercial Contracts (~$500M+)

* **NASA, ESA, and Gateway projects**: Ongoing space infrastructure work includes solar arrays, modular structures, payload services, and ISS/Gateway support. These contracts are multiyear and locked in. → **Estimated 2026 revenue: $220M–$260M**
* **DeepSat & VLEO satellite programs**: Redwire’s AI-powered digital engineering suite (Acorn 2.0, DEMSI) is powering the next-gen Earth intelligence constellations. The commercial + defense dual-use value here is growing. → **Est. 2026: $100M–$140M**
* **Space servicing, robotics, in-orbit manufacturing (Archinaut, payload integration, etc.)**: RDW is one of the few players with actual flight heritage. → **Est. 2026: $80M–$120M**

# 2. Defense Related (Edge Autonomy) (~$200M+)

* **Edge Autonomy’s Drone platforms**: U.S. Marine Corps visit last week, partnerships, and modular drone production give Edge a key role in the drone race. → **Est. 2026**: **$180M–$250M**
* **AI payloads & systems**: Defense customers increasingly need smart, modular payloads with in-orbit/real-time data processing. RDW is already delivering.

# 3. Major Defense Initiatives (Potential Windfalls)

* **SHIELD (U.S. Missile Defense Agency – $151B IDIQ)** Redwire is a top digital integrator candidate for SHIELD, a 10-year missile defense architecture focused on AI and multi-domain ops. Redwire’s edge in model-based systems engineering and space-based sensors positions it for repeat task orders. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $130M–$250M**
* **Golden Dome / NATO Missile Defense Integration** Edge Autonomy’s modular drones and Redwire’s sensor payloads align well with NATO missile defense requirements. NATO’s expanded investment strategy (\~$100B+ in new EU-NATO air defense cooperation) increases the likelihood of Edge/Redwire tech integration. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $60M–$100M**
* **U.S. “Unleashing American Drone Dominance” Initiative (FY2026 DoD Budget: $1.01T)** The U.S. military’s sharp focus on modular Drones, smart payloads, and speed-to-field gives Edge Autonomy a prime role. Redwire’s AI-driven mission systems could scale across platforms. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $90M–$130M**
* **EU Defense & Space Surge: €131B Allocation (2028–2034)** On July 17, 2025, the European Commission proposed a €2 trillion ($2.31T) EU budget for 2028–2034. Crucially, it includes €131 billion earmarked for defense and space, a fivefold increase over current levels. Additionally, a new €451B European Competitiveness Fund will support dual-use industries like satellites and AI payloads. Redwire’s expanding European footprint and NATO linkages make it well-positioned to benefit. → **Est. 2026 revenue (early access + ramp-up): $40M–$80M**
* **Trump-EU Arms Procurement Continuity** The Trump-era U.S.–EU defense deal includes “hundreds of billions” in new EU purchases of U.S. military equipment. Redwire’s and autonomy platforms are ideal for this transatlantic arms buildup. → **Est. 2026 revenue: $30M–$60M**

# 4. Software, AI, and Classified Work (High Margin)

* **Digital Engineering Platforms (Acorn 2.0, DEMSI)** These are becoming the backbone for both satellite and defense mission planning. → **Est. 2026**: **$40M–$60M**
* **Classified payloads and integration work** Indications from filings and DoD partnerships suggest growing classified backlog. → **Est. 2026: $30M–$60M**

# 5. Strategic Assets, IP, and Non-Recurring Revenue

* **Patents & IP Licensing**: Redwire owns critical IP in 3D printing in microgravity (Archinaut), space-rated materials, digital mission engineering tools (Acorn 2.0), and autonomous systems. Licensing or IP monetization (especially in allied countries ramping defense production) could generate non-linear returns. → **Est. 2026: $20M–$40M**
* **One-off or Non-Recurring Government Grants**: Given the surge in public-private space and biotech investments (e.g., autonomous bio payloads, ISS commercialization), Redwire may secure one-time grants or milestone payments. → **Est. 2026**: **$10M–$30M**
* **Strategic JVs or Divestitures**: Redwire could form joint ventures in Europe, spin off commercial units (e.g., in-orbit manufacturing), or license key tech to allies. → **Est. 2026: $25M–$50M**

**Estimated RDW Revenue by Source for 2026**

|Source|Estimated Revenue Range (Million USD)|

|2028|$1.6B–$2.0B|6×–10×|$9.6B–$20.0B|**+319% to +773%**|

# Why This Matters

* **Q2 Earnings will show the first signs of operating leverage.**
* **Free cash flow flips positive by 2025-end**, accelerating into 2026.
* **AI + Defense + Space = Holy Trinity of Multiples**
* **Low float + high institutional interest** = re-rating catalyst
* Market cap as of today is **$2.29 billion!!!**

**If 2026 plays out as outlined, Redwire could cement itself as a foundational piece of U.S. and allied space-defense infrastructure. Redwire is quietly building the bones of a multi-decade national asset, and with execution, it could someday be worth tens or even hundreds of billions.**

Piper Sandler says Trump's tariffs are illegal.,1mbe915,RepairmanJack2025,2025-07-28 12:00:28,1489,0.88,157,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mbe915/piper_sandler_says_trumps_tariffs_are_illegal/,"Trump's tariffs are illegal, according to Piper Sandler.  

""As it did in April, the firm argues that the IEEPA, enacted in 1977, was designed to give the president certain emergency economic powers, but not blanket authority to set tariffs. Courts have consistently rejected the idea that the statute includes such sweeping power.""

These tariffs are unlikely to be permanently overturned before middle of next year, though.  So, for the time being, we are stuck with them.

I think once they are permanently overturned, the market will react positively, and continue to go higher, as the tariffs are obviously very damaging economically, so their permanent removal is quite bullish.

Aurora Innovations (AUR) - Current front runner in autonomous trucking software and hardware,1marvt0,you_are_wrong_tho,2025-07-27 17:16:42,74,0.91,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1marvt0/aurora_innovations_aur_current_front_runner_in/,"


https://aurora.tech/

Looking into AUR next. Autonomous trucking hardware/software company. Summary:

    •    Cash on hand: $1.15–1.2B

    •    Burn rate: $142M/Q or $600–700M/annually

    •    Runway: ~6–7 quarters (18–22 months), assuming no change

    •    To extend this runway, Aurora must either reduce burn, raise new funds, or both before cash reserves are exhausted.


Aurora Innovation has established strategic partnerships with several leading companies to advance the development and deployment of its self-driving technology, particularly for autonomous trucks. Key partnerships include those with Nvidia and Continental, focusing on both the software and hardware aspects of autonomous driving systems. Other significant collaborations involve companies like Uber Freight, FedEx, Hirschbach Motor Lines, PACCAR, Ryder, Schneider, and Volvo, reflecting a broad ecosystem approach to commercializing autonomous trucking. 


Aurora Innovation (AUR) was co-founded by Chris Urmson, the former chief technology officer of Google/Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving team, which became known as Waymo, as well as by Sterling Anderson, former head of Tesla Autopilot, and Drew Bagnell, former head of Uber's autonomy and perception team.

They are already doing test runs between Houston and Dallas, and just started a run between El Paso and Phoenix (a 1000 mile, 14 hour run that currently cannot legally be done by a single human driver in a day due to a max of 11 hours driving time allowed). This is part of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA) Hours of Service (HOS) regulations. The 11 hours of driving must be taken within a 14-consecutive-hour period, after at least 10 consecutive hours off duty. 

This is a huge advantage of autonomous trucks, they can operate 24 hours a day with no breaks legally required. 

So they have a huge runway right now for cash on hand compared to cash burn, they seem to be one of the leaders compared to Waymo (Waymo stopped doing trucking and focused solely on cab company)

A couple other speculative competitors but the closest is a privately owned company so can’t invest in it anyway. My guess is there is no winner take all for self driving and most likely a competition based future until one rockets to the front of the pack by being head and shoulders above the others…Which could be 5-10 years from now, but plenty of money to be made between now and then. Google and AUR are the best bets. 

Multi year hold for real gains, could still easily see a 100% gain in the next 0.5-2 years. Potential 10x by 2030.  

Aur at $11b market cap today, Waymo is like $45b right now. 
Most analysts have it valued at $10 a share. 
 
No debt and $1b cash on hand is really nice. 

Holding 3000 shares and $4000 worth of Jan 2026 $10 calls and $10-$15 2027 leaps.

That caught my attention. Not too long ago, the general narrative was that building chips in the US was way too expensive and not competitive. But if yields are now matching and cost is only slightly higher (and maybe getting closer with scale/subsidies), doesn't that have some real upside?

Could this be a legit competitive advantage for US-based companies - like less risk from geopolitics, better supply chain control, and potentially more favorable government support (CHIPS Act, etc.)?

Chase takes 30 to 60 seconds to identify, enter and submit a trade. The process is slow; I trade there infrequently. 

Webull is much faster for example but the requirements for take profit and stop loss are too tight.

What advice can you all give for a fast platform that allows faster trades with fewer restrictions like, for example... I have this idea where I can snatch a penny per share (could be a nickel, dime whatever)

I hit a button to buy and simultaneously tell the order to automatically sell (take profit) when the ticker goes up a penny but allow for a stop loss at a nickel or some configurable threshold.

Buy at $99.99 sell at 100 or allow it to fall as low as $99.94 in the process. (Examples are obviously just made up)

Webull has this idea but forces what seems to be a 5%-10% range so I never get it the way I'd like unless I manually move the limits after the order is executed. By that time my take profit order is old news.

Why Profitable Traders Don’t Share Their Strategies And It Finally Makes Sense to Me,1mai78i,JewelerCautious9365,2025-07-27 09:38:06,202,0.69,123,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mai78i/why_profitable_traders_dont_share_their/,"I’ve spent four years in the markets now. Honestly, the first three were roughlots of blown accounts and endless trial and error. It wasn’t until my fourth year that I finally found some consistency. And in that process, I realized something big that I didn’t understand before: genuinely profitable traders almost never give away their real strategies. They don’t share the exact setups, entry rules, or detailed execution plans. You mostly just hear them talk about general ideas, mindset tips, and broad principles.

At first, I thought this was just them gatekeeping. But after getting some real experience, I see why they do it.

Here’s the reality: once a strategy goes public, it stops working as well. The market adapts. Big players adjust. And most retail traders start doing the same thingsentering at the same spots, putting stop losses in predictable places, and walking straight into traps.

Take Smart Money Concepts or the basics of support and resistance trading. It all seems straightforward until your perfect stop gets hit just before a big move. That’s not random; it’s institutions taking advantage of predictable retail behavior. The minute everyone knows the rules, the rules change.

Even my mentor who’s been trading for over 10 yearsnever handed me a plug-and-play strategy. He taught me frameworks, risk management, and how to think about the market, but never gave me a simple “buy here, sell there” system. Now I get it: if he had, and I used it carelessly or shared it around, we’d both lose our edge. Any real advantage in the market disappears once it’s out in the open.

And if we’re being honest, a lot of people don’t actually want to learn. They just want shortcuts. That’s why real traders usually only share deeper insights with people who show they’re serious and willing to think for themselves.

Bottom line: a strategy isn’t just the systemit’s your timing, risk management, confidence, and execution. Those things can’t be copied.

So if you’re still chasing someone else’s edge, maybe it’s time to start building your own.",2025-07-27,0.9393,Positive,[]

Figuring out the Figma IPO! (DD on $FIG),1ma8fm5,WinningWatchlist,2025-07-27 00:13:47,273,0.91,216,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ma8fm5/figuring_out_the_figma_ipo_dd_on_fig/,"# I love IPOs.

The last IPO I thought was amazing was Coreweave, and I posted about it [(and how far we've come!).](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jllj7u/coreweave_the_biggest_ipo_of_2025_dd_on_crwv/) Figma is IPOing on the 31st and it's going to be a big one.

**Figuring Figma Out:**

What is Figma? Figma is a ""cloud-based collaborate design platform"". The company boasts of being able to help you ""Prompt, code, and design from first idea to final product"". Imagine how useful Microsoft Office is to the average white collar worker, and that's what Figma is to the average designer.

(If you need a ELI5 and have the attention span of a 2 year old watching Cocomelon [watch this video from their site](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/14563969806359-What-is-Figma), it's got bright colors kids crave)

Figma began with [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/) for UI/UX designers, [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) for diagramming, then [**Dev Mode** ](https://www.figma.com/dev-mode/)for developers. Figma aims to be the entire suite for product design and runs on a freemium plan.

**The FIGnancials:**

Figma is going public at a **\~$15 billion** valuation (and releasing 37 million shares at $25-$28 each). This IPO aims to raise \~$1.1B,  listing on the NYSE  as $**FIG**.



| Metric|FY 2022|FY 2023|FY 2024|Q1 2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|$324M|$505M (+56%)|$749M (+48%)|$228.2M (+46% YoY)|
|Gross Profit|$284.5M|$456.2M|$666.4M|$200.1M|
|Gross Margin|87.80%|90.40%|88.90%|87.70%|
|Operating Income (Loss)|\-$72.4M|$720.1M (w/ $1B Adobe fee)|\-$715.8M|$39.5M|
|Net Income (Loss)|\-$85.9M|$738.0M|\-$732.1M (incl. \~$800M SBC)|$44.9M|



* From table above: FIG's revenue has been grown (on average), 50% YoY. Gross Margin has been consistent at roughly \~90% (which is in-line with ADBE's as well, the typical pure software company tries for 80%+ gross margin).
* Adjusting for that, Figma has operated near breakeven and holds $1.5B+ in cash, no debt, and owns $100M of Bitcoin through ETFs (lol).
* Figma has also experienced a pretty large loss in 2023, \~$700M which was made up for with the breakup fee from ADBE's attempted acquisition.

Figma's growth strategy comes from its freemium model- individuals can use a free tier, but adding designers and collaborators takes money and organizations need to upgrade to paid per-seat plans, which allows them more flexibility vs just charging everyone the same price the UI/UX designers pay.  Figma also has massive market capture- they have 13M MAU (monthly active users) and in their S-1, they state that ""95% of Fortune 500 companies use Figma"".

As of Q1 2025, **70% of Figma’s revenue comes from the top-tier Organization & Enterprise plans,** and has a robust community-built plug-in ecosystem. (Kind of like how Skyrim has 200K mods because people like making crazy things for others to use/enjoy, Figma has 10K plug-ins/widgets). Figma estimates its **Total Addressable Market (TAM) at \~$33 billion** for design collaboration software, so they clearly can highlight markets to grow in. Their vision is to move from a single design tool to an “operating system” for product development that every stakeholder in a project uses.

Regarding OpEx, Figma historically reinvested heavily in growth (R&D, hiring, global expansion)  which kept it near breakeven, excluding one-offs in 2023/2024. This is pretty typical for startups trying to scale and those that are heavily invested in tech.

In 2024, it recorded a net loss of $732.1M, but \~$850M of that was an ""extraordinary stock-based compensation"" charge related to an RSU liquidity event after the Adobe deal was terminated. Removing that one-time cost, Figma was roughly at breakeven in 2024. In 2023, it showed a $738M profit, due to Adobe paying a $1.0B merger termination fee. Excluding that, 2023 was also around break-even . But by late 2024-2025, Figma’s core business turned profitable: Q1 2025 operating income was \~$40M with a 17% GAAP operating margin, and $45M net income. From an operating leverage standpoint, they have close to $1.5B in cash post-IPO.

**The Valuation:**

With a $15B valuation and \~821M LTM (last 12 months) revenue, the IPO pricing implies \~20x price to sales. This will likely open at even higher than that, so if you're not allocated shares you have an even higher P/S ratio you're buying at. In comparison, ADBE trades at 10x sales (but FIG has higher growth and retention).

**The bull case** here is that $FIG successfully penetrates every single major company that requires design work done (all of them that don't make their advertisements in Paint) and becomes the standard for UI/UX work, like how Zoom is the standard for video calls, or Microsoft Office is the standard for every office worker. It already has a 80% market share among designers, and has extreme stickiness. They can acquire users with zero marketing (I've looked at the free tier myself and it's decently robust), and 70% of enterprises deals originate from a single user on a self-serve plan. This means that they don't have miserable sales reps emailing you to try their products, they have in-house adoption. FIG is already profitable, and has $1.5B in cash after the IPO. There's far less liquidity risk, and that means it won't need to dilute. It can also continue investing in R&D, and developing new products.

**The bear case** for FIG is that they have a \~$16B valuation for \~$1B run-rate revenue and price around 15-20x forward sales. For software in general, that's top of range. Even ADBE trades around 7-10x sales in general (and we've seen the massive bleeds ADBE does when it misses earnings). If Figma ever reports falling revenue or less than 50% growth then it's likely that there'll be a massive selloff and it won't be pretty.

Competitors in the space are Adobe, Canva (which has 100M already and targets small business users), and is valued at $26B privately, Webflow (which competes with Figma Sites). The massive adoption that Figma has had among Fortune 500 companies is a double edged sword- it shows that their product is amazing but also shows they need to monetize more deeply through the companies they've penetrated. AI also serves as both a tool and a threat because of competitors using it and because it lowers the number of people who actually need a Figma membership to participate in the design process, so Figma's growth depends on upselling their products and developing new ones. Essentially, they're cannibalizing their own market due to AI.

Figma has also hinted at changing their pricing model- such as token-based pricing for AI features. These changes can come with MASSIVE backlash (it's one of the reason Cursor kind of screwed themselves out of users) and can easily have users turn to a different product if they no longer love the pricing.

**IPO Logistics and how I'm going to trade it**

Figma has a dual-class share structure, where the CEO Dylan Field holds super-voting shares worth 15 votes each and a proxy on his co-founder’s shares. This means Field controls >50% of voting power, and thus the company. This isn't so important on the day of IPO, but is important to note going forward into the future. Additionally, a large portion of shares sold in the IPO are from **existing shareholders cashing out (\~24M/37M are secondary)**, which can be seen as a slight red flag (insiders taking significant money off the table now).

As mentioned before, Figma is pricing at $25-28 a share. I think it's completely unlikely to price at this range and will likely price at $30+, simply because we're in the hype cycle of the IPO market and Figma is a well known name. Given that Adobe offered $20B for Figma back in 2022, I think it's completely within the realm of possibility that we open higher.

**Figma is using an auction-style allocation method. (very important!)**

This is relatively uncommon from the normal IPOs you see. This means that institutional investors submit bids on both shares and price and that determines at what price the stock will open, so this means that it's less likely (but not impossible) to experience that ""pop"" that CRCL had on the day of IPO, and instead will likely just open up and reduce the EV of the trade.

Personally I have put in an order for allocated shares (whether this goes through or not is anyone's guess) , depending on whether I get a suitable amount of shares or not I will buy more at the opening.

I have been investing in the stock market for 5 years, I started at the beginning of 2021.

I was doing moderately well, but invested a big amount of my portfolio in a company that eventually went bankrupt. Since then, I’ve thankfully been more careful and not repeated the same mistake.

Here’s my issue, I’ll find a stock that seems to have a great investment thesis behind it (say GOOGL for example) but I’ll take a look at their chart and see that just 4 months ago, GOOGL was at $140s (now in the $190s) and as a result, I’ll immediately put it aside and wait for a pull back as it has already gone up 30% in 4 months, despite the fact that GOOGL’s is still almost flat since last year.

Likewise, when a company is at a complete all time low, I’ll say that it could always get worse and leave it! A good example - I saw EL back at the beginning of April, just after Michael Burry announced he sold off pretty much all his US equities and loaded up on EL. I saw the huge drop after their earnings and said “look at that, Burry bought but even still it isn’t the time to buy” - EL is up almost 90% since then. Even right now, EL is down 10% since last year, but I still won’t touch it because it’s already up 90% from its deep low.

I’m not sure if it’s just me that struggles with it, or if there are others here that do the same, but it feels like I keep missing out on large opportunities because I keep trying to time things tightly. I’m curious if anyone had any insight.

I am following Biogen in more detail and healthcare sector in general for some time now and starting to see patterns. 

**Biogen is not liked by market**; it is hated due to bad messup with the FDA on Aduhelm, however, it still possesses a substantial cash flow producing portfolio and will do so for at least 5-10 next years + there are few potential blockbusters that according to my models are not really priced in atm; it does lack a very large and healthy pipeline, which has been tackled by recent acquisitions of drug rights. 

At the same time, **whole Healthcare sector is in a brutal downturn and overlooked by the market**. **Based on my research and insights from analysts like Marko Kolanovic (link below), whole Healthcare is in a value zone, and I see Biogen also possessing a few extra aces that are overlooked by most of the market.**

I did an in-depth analysis of Biogen and am ready to discuss with you! Looking forward to comments.
 
I do own stocks of Biogen. This is not a financial advice and please do your own due diligence.

FUBO as a possible long term investment?,1m9zkbc,shoop_da_woop12,2025-07-26 17:46:42,30,0.77,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1m9zkbc/fubo_as_a_possible_long_term_investment/,"Wondering how you all see FUBO in the future. It started as a sports streaming service and now does news, entertainment as well. Streaming is a tough market, especially with big competitors like YouTube TV, Netflix. 

Their last earnings haven’t been great, but they have improved. Back in January there was news it was going to merge with HULU, causing the stock to go from about $1.25 to $6.50 overnight. Now it sits around $3.6/share. 

A couple things hold it back. The merger isn’t set to happen until 2026. Further, the DOJ is set to rule on possible antitrust with concerns of a monopoly, as Disney owns HULU. 

Some argue DOJ will knock it down while others are confident it will pass, which would give FUBO greater access to subscribers and cash flow. 

I’ll admit I’m deep in the stock. If this company successfully merges, it could be a long term winner. Would love to know your thoughts. ",2025-07-26,0.9868,Positive,"['FUBO', 'TV', 'HULU', 'DOJ', 'HULU', 'DOJ', 'FUBO']"

The co-owner of a company that has been working on fixing Nvidia's gaming GPUs for 15 years and started working on AI chips at the end of 2024 said, “The demand for repairs is really high.”

The report says that business has been so good that the owners have set up a new company to handle these orders, which can now repair up to 500 Nvidia AI chips per month.

“The market is clearly more competitive than a year ago. However, much of the aggressive pricing is coming from MGAs and front-end companies. While there are some highly regarded MGAs out there with long track records of success, the model as a whole is challenged by a misalignment of interest. Some front-end companies are posting unsustainable gross loss ratios of 100% or higher signaling capital destruction. Notably on our largest reserve line, other liability occurrence, the top 6 E&S fronting carriers are projecting 2024 gross loss ratios well below ours despite consistently worse experience in older accident years and consistently worse loss development. Either they, as a group, have experienced a miraculous turnaround where they are under reserving. Eventually, loss reserves turn into paid claims and posting inadequate reserves only pushes the problem down the road for a time. The situation is reminiscent on a smaller scale of the mortgage crisis of 2008 where you had a misalignment of interest between the originators and barriers of risk, which resulted in a fundamental mispricing of that risk. Given the size of the problem, this will not be as significant for the economy as the mortgage crisis, but it will be very significant for the insurance industry and for some players in particular.”

Some of the fronting carriers I have heard of:-
- Transverse 
- State National
- Accelerant 
- Sutton National
- Palomar $PLMR

I think the magic formula (Earnings Yield & Roic) is kind of the essence of value (Earnings Yield) & quality (Roic) investing. However what boggles my mind is how no one is adressing the shortfalls regarding Cyclicality: There are so many industries with a smaller or larger exposure to cycles. From extreme commity price cycles to corona invest cycles or consumer spending cycles like in luxury. 

While being on the cycle top the return in the roic of the trailing twelve month is strechted as well as the earnings in the earnings yield. So if there is any mean reversion in earnings this overestimates the ranking in the magic formula approach for both criteria!

There hasn’t been a single -1% day in the major averages in over 75 trading days which is a record. Market up nearly 30% from the lows. Dollar down 10% this year. Groceries 30% more expensive. The list goes on and on.

I know cloud revenues have increased but they were prior to the huge jump in capex. Are they really seeing a net benefit that can outpace spending? xAi/Elon is shoveling out $1B a month. How do any of the large language models make money ever? 

I know people have been on JPows ass lately but he’s doing what he should be doing. He can’t cut rates and shouldn’t.

This is not the first time that AMD has been at a disadvantage. This isn't the first time AMD has been at a disadvantage, and it's highly unlikely that AMD will overtake NVIDIA in market capitalization in the next few years, but the gap is certainly closing. Over the past year, AMD has been dubbed a “senior money destroyer” by investors as Wall Street analysts' price targets have fallen along with AMD's stock price, but that's now reversing. Market optimism, AMD's win over NVIDIA in AI inference, its partnership with the Middle East, and OpenAI's favoring of AMD GPUs have led to a rebound in the stock and Wall Street has raised its price target. Global investment in AI infrastructure is only going to increase, with McKinsey estimating that by 2030 the figure will be as high as $7 trillion. AI reasoning is essential during this tech boom. If AMD introduces a better product for this specific element in its GPUs, AMD will significantly close the gap as customers will want AMD GPUs for inference rather than training.

AMD is positioning itself for the future in the inference space rather than competing with NVIDIA in the training space now.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I have been doing a ton of research over the past few weeks as to what portfolio I can dumb money in long term while going to sleep at night and I wanted to share my outcome so far with you all. Please give me your honest opinion. The goal of my research was to create a portfolio that has a piece of major sectors so that it grows well over time but also provides income. I chose 5 areas to focus both on growth and income. Those areas are S&P, Technology ETF, Real Estate, Bitcoin, Gold. The income is the ETFs that sells options on those 5 by NEOS.

Here is my portfolio result so far:

• 50% Growth: 

VOO - S&P500 

VGT - Technology 

VNQ - Real Estate 

MSTR - Bitcoin 

AAAU - Gold



• 50% Income: 

SPYI - Monthly Options Income On S&P 

QQQI - Monthly Options Income On QQQ 

BTCI - Monthly Options Income On Bitcoin 

IYRI - Monthly Options Income On Gold 

IAUI - Monthly Options Income On Real Estate

This portfolio gained 32% this year and provides 8.5% a year income distributed monthly.

My logic is that this gives exposure to main areas of the market, hedges against inflation, protects capital by capital appreciation, and gives monthly income based on all the underlying.

When COVID hit,  solution was massive money printing again.  
And it worked. Markets bounced back, the system didn’t collapse.

Now it feels like every crisis just leads to the same response: **Printing more money.**  
it’s become a habit. A learned behavior.

And honestly, the U.S. doesn’t even *pretend* to care about paying down its national debt anymore.  
They just keep rolling it over,, kick the can down the road.

Even this whole push for stablecoins feels like another version of **passing the burden forward** like a digital shell game to absorb more U.S. debt while buying time.

But at the end of the day, who pays for all this?

**Ordinary people who save money.**

  
People who saves consistently through diligently and honestly everyday are getting crushed.  
Just sitting still means your money loses value every year.

In a world of reckless money printing and wild inflation, the only real defense is **owning assets.**

Index funds, Big tech stocks, gold, crypto, real estate  
basically **anything they can’t print into oblivion.**

The question is whether consumers will really prioritize self-driving over things like brand, range, or price when it comes down to buying a car.

If Xpeng can pull it off, maybe it grabs share from the big mass-market players or from the ones that aren’t innovating fast enough. But if buyers don’t care as much as expected, then the focus on FSD might not move the needle.

Now I keep staring at my portfolio wondering if I just made the dumbest move ever. I’m not a pro trader, just someone trying to build a decent long-term portfolio and maybe catch a winner here and there.

Why Lantheus? Well, they’re in the healthcare space, mainly diagnostics and imaging (stuff like Pylarify for prostate cancer and Definity for heart ultrasound). It sounded like a solid niche – not super flashy like tech stocks, but important. I figured healthcare is always needed, so maybe this would be more stable than chasing hype.

Problem is… I looked deeper after buying (rookie mistake, I know). Stock’s been dropping hard this year, revenue growth slowed a bit, and earnings last quarter weren’t amazing. The price was way higher before, so part of me thinks “hey, maybe I got a discount.” But another part of me is like “dude, what if you just bought a falling knife?”

I keep reading mixed stuff online – some analysts say it’s still undervalued with good long-term prospects, others say it’s just stuck. Now I’m kinda torn between holding long term (since the company is profitable and still innovating) or cutting my losses if it slides further.

So yeah, anyone here actually holding LNTH or following it closely? Is it worth just riding out the storm, or did I pay way too much at 83? I can take the honest truth, just trying to figure out if I messed up or not.

Do Retailors actually deserve to win against algo giants?,1n6nzt9,ProSamGamer,2025-09-02 16:20:49,0,0.46,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n6nzt9/do_retailors_actually_deserve_to_win_against_algo/,"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I sometimes wonder: maybe retail investors *shouldn’t* be trying to beat HFTs at their own game.

Think about it, if you’re a firm spending hundreds of millions on infrastructure, talent, and regulation, isn’t it natural that you dominate short-term moves?

So maybe the real problem isn’t that retail can’t win, but that we’re playing the wrong game. There is no way a simple person who trades with his phone / laptop compete with high frequency traders. There comes a point where skill just cannot beat speed and algorithms. 

So what i was thinking is that instead of trying to scalp or day trade like algos, maybe retail should focus on strategies where speed doesn’t matter as much. Long term trading is i think the most viable and safe options for retailors to trade.  
Short term and intraday is becoming more and more competitive with big firms investing billions of dollars and even small algo traders have started to enter the market.

Lululemon (LULU) Earnings This Thursday: Can They Keep Their Premium Growth in a Mixed Retail Market?,1n6ny15,Optionslab,2025-09-02 16:19:00,8,0.73,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n6ny15/lululemon_lulu_earnings_this_thursday_can_they/,"TL;DR: Lululemon reports earnings Thursday. The brand’s been crushing it for years, but retail is all over the place right now. Can they keep the streak alive?

Lululemon is set to report this week and it’s one of those names people in retail always watch. The company has been a growth machine, selling pricey athletic wear and somehow convincing people to keep paying up. That’s impressive in itself.

The question is whether they can keep it going. Retail as a whole has been pretty uneven lately. Some companies are doing fine, others are hurting. For LULU, it comes down to a few things: are people still showing up in their core markets, is international expansion actually working, and can they keep margins solid even with inflation and more competition? And of course, guidance will be the big one, especially with the holidays coming up.

Can you guys let me know if theres anything I can do to better improve my investments in the long run? Here is my current standing:

I have a 401K and HSA with the company with investments going into VOO, SP500 and VTPSX.

I also have a company stock purchase option which I get @ 15% discount which I can contribute up to 10% of my salary to, which I also Max out on.

I want to do something with my stock options since my company stock isnt moving has been kind of stagnant lately and the dividends is pretty low too.

The stock purchase is done at the first week of every month and its about $800 of stock thats purchased every time.

Im thinking to setup recurring transfers of what stock that I have held for over year and put it either into a Roth, a life insurance policy, bonds, 529/trump account for my kid.

I believe i would have enough stock accumulated over a year to max out the Roth contribution. Should I do that or should I diversify it even more to other accounts?

I think i can still ""pay"" myself like $100 or $200 a month which should be enough for my own liking.

"The SCO Summit and What It Means: Building Paths, Claiming Legitimacy, and Shaping a Post-Unipolar System",1n6mmof,purple95spirit,2025-09-02 15:29:34,3,0.71,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n6mmof/the_sco_summit_and_what_it_means_building_paths/,"The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit illustrates how major economies are building alternative paths for trade, finance, and connectivity, aiming to reduce their reliance on a system dominated by the dollar and Western institutions. The SCO claims legitimacy through scale, representing nearly half the world’s population, controlling vast energy reserves, and sitting across trade corridors that stretch from East Asia to the Middle East. Its appeal grows from the perception that the existing global framework has suffered from what can be called Washington corrosion, a slow erosion of trust in institutions like the WTO, IMF, and World Bank as they came to be viewed not as impartial guardians of stability but as instruments of policy for one capital. Structural adjustment programs imposed heavy costs, sanctions were applied selectively, and the “rules-based order” was increasingly perceived as rules for some and exceptions for others. In that environment, building redundancy makes sense: settlement in local currencies, proposals for a development bank, commodity-anchored trade, digital payment systems, and new infrastructure corridors are designed to function regardless of whether Washington approves.

Yet there is another argument, often raised in Washington and Europe, that the corrosion of global rules did not start with the United States but with China. When Beijing joined the WTO in 2001 it promised to liberalize markets and reduce state subsidies, but critics argue that state-owned enterprises retained privileged access, intellectual property enforcement lagged, and industrial policy remained central. In their view, the WTO’s mechanisms were never built to handle a system of that scale where the state and market are intertwined, and the institution looked powerless. From this perspective, China’s way of using the system undermined its credibility, leading the U.S. to turn toward unilateral tariffs and industrial strategies. Others counter that China largely followed the rules as written, and the real flaw lay in outdated institutions that were never designed to absorb a country of China’s size and model. Either way, the outcome was the same: the framework weakened, trust eroded, and the path to fragmentation opened.

What the SCO summit represents is the rational next step once confidence in a single system falters. In the short term, these alternatives provide insurance against disruptions in dollar clearance or sanctions. In the medium term, they allow flexibility: oil and gas priced in multiple currencies, infrastructure projects financed without IMF strings, and payment rails that link Asia to the Middle East independent of Western intermediaries. In the long term they signal a dual system where the dollar remains powerful but no longer unrivaled. For the unipolar framework this is not collapse but gradual erosion, accelerated both by Washington’s own politicization of institutions and by China’s outsized role in reshaping global trade. The SCO builds legitimacy in the space left behind, promising resilience through diversification and redundancy. The global economy is heading toward an equilibrium where no single hub dictates the rules, but where multiple hubs compete, negotiate, and coexist, making the system more complex, more fragmented, and perhaps more resilient than the one it is slowly replacing.

For U.S. investors this environment means opportunity and risk at the same time. Commodities such as gold, silver, and uranium are likely to gain from their growing role as anchors of trust, and emerging markets tied to new trade corridors could see capital inflows and stronger equity performance. At the same time, U.S. multinationals that rely on frictionless global supply chains and dollar-based settlement may face margin pressure and higher financing costs if capital flows fragment further. The dollar will not vanish, but its monopoly status is under challenge, and that suggests a more volatile backdrop where diversification into commodities, select emerging markets, and hedges against currency weakness will become part of prudent long-term strategy.",2025-09-02,0.9824,Positive,"['SCO', 'WTO', 'IMF', 'WTO', 'WTO', 'SCO', 'IMF', 'SCO']"

Start with $100

Stock goes up 10% so $100 -> $100 * 1.1 = $110

Stock goes down 10% so $110 -> $110 * 0.9 = $99

Thus we are assuming that the price of any neutral stock that fluctuates will decay to zero.

But isn’t this unfair?

Isn’t it more reasonable to assume that a neutral stock behaves in the following way:

Start with $100

Stock goes up so $100 -> $100 * 1.1 = $110

Stock goes down $110 -> $110 / 1.1 = $100

So that the compound growth is 0%

Im looking not at stocks but at the things we're its 500 companies in one. Im aiming for the least amount of risk.
       My questions is how does taxed work in all this? Will it even be worth it if I get taxed when im buying/keeping/selling? Also I heard somewhere that its the worst time to start investing because Trump is messing stuff up? But does that not matter because im willing to ride out the ups and the downs until my mid thirties. And is there anything you want to add? Who would you recommend I watch on YouTube get a better idea of all this?

Consensus views it as a failed technology story destined for irrelevance.

What's more likely going on? Management has aggressively restructured by divesting Geomagic, retiring $88M debt at a discount, and repurchasing 8M shares. The balance sheet now holds net cash ($134M vs $123M debt). Cost initiatives reduced Q2 adjusted EBITDA loss to $5M on $95M revenue. High value niches are growing with aerospace and defense up 84% YoY, and personalized medical solutions up double digits. Gross margins are stabilizing near 38% despite tariff headwinds.

DDD trades near 0.8x sales and below book value, despite having net cash and a clear path to breakeven by 2026. Stabilization of revenue and margins would warrant 1.5-2x sales and support a $5-7 share price, 2-3x upside. Industry consolidation remains a catalyst. DDD attempted to merge with Stratasys previously, and at this depressed valuation it could itself be acquired.

The major risks are that demand adoption may remain slow, competition persists, and execution on cost control must continue. These risks are reflected in the current multi-year low valuation.

Leveraging my Roth IRA through Lifecycle Investing | Q3 2025,1n5uqwz,tooclouds,2025-09-01 17:19:42,1,0.57,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n5uqwz/leveraging_my_roth_ira_through_lifecycle/,"**Today, September 1st 2025**

Welcome back to my controversial investing journey where I use lifecycle investing to incorporate leverage in my Roth IRA. I am 28 years old, with roughly $18,300 in my Roth IRA. I’ve bought one LEAP on VTI at a 150 strike when VTI traded at 300 to try to achieve 2x leverage. Given my current portfolio size, my leverage is now sitting at 1.7x. Guess what I was thinking the whole time while starting this? I should just call it quits while I'm ahead and go back to 1x leverage or I should sell all my stock and diversify into the 3-fund portfolio. These feelings would be much worse if the market had actually gone down and I ended up losing twice as much as the S&P500. Now that I'm at the point of rebalancing and I've reread some of the sections from Lifecycle Investing pertaining to my situation and I've decided to do nothing for my Q3 portfolio. 

Reasons:

1. I'm still within the 0.5x goal from my 2x leverage target. 
2. The authors have commented on a question regarding the CAPE ratio being higher than historical average and their calculator recommending 0% invested into stocks by saying that in today's times it would matter more to look at the equity risk premium (which I believe sits around 5% depending on which source you use) to determine whether to de-leverage. 
   1. In general, when the equity risk premium is <3% this indicates bonds may be a better investment, 4-6% suggests a 60/40 or a 70/30 stock to bond allocation, and >6% suggests potentially having a 100% stock portfolio. You will generally only see >6% during market downturns or recessions. 
3. I am 28 years old. At this age per the book, I should still maintain my 2x leverage. 

In conclusion I've really been feeling that quote from Peter Lynch ""your worst enemy is yourself"" because I always want to deviate from the strategy out of fear/greed. Ultimately I want as little of my opinion as possible. I hesitated to do this for a long time because I knew that once I started, I could never stop. The worse case scenario would be starting now and going back to the traditional buy and hold strategy after a market crash when that should theoretically be the best time to implement this strategy. With all this being said, I believe that the best strategy may ultimately be the one that you can stick with. That's all for this quarter, see you in December.

Please see below for the current information regarding the trade. Which I will be updating every quarter (every 3 months).

Performance:

Initial investment (June 2025): $15,611.64

Current investment (Sept 2025): $18,324.21

Below, I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement.

**What Is Lifecycle Investing?**

Lifecycle investing, by Ayres and Nalebuff, argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth (including future earnings) is much larger than their current savings. Since most young investors have little capital available for investment, but decades of future earnings, they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans. As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal, you should gradually reduce risk.

How to do this:

* First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share.
* Use leverage through either margin, leveraged ETFs, or deep-in-the-money LEAPs
* Reduce leverage over time, shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bonds/real-estate and cash as retirement nears.

**My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation**

06/2025:

With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can’t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I’ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn’t offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF’s trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do). 

**Plan**

* Quarterly Recalculation:
   * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share.
   * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s.

1. De-leverage Schedule:
   * Ages 27–30: Maintain 2x leverage.
   * Ages 30–40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase.
   * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation.
   * Ages 50–59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real-estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches.

**Risk Management and Contingencies**

* Time decay: I’ll monitor the LEAP’s theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage.
* Market extremes: ~~If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence.~~ 
   * Switching to looking at Equity Risk Premium after seeing a discussion on bogleheads with the authors. 
* Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal.

**Summary**

I’m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 28 year old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I’ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years.",2025-09-01,0.943,Positive,"['IRA', 'IRA', 'LEAP', 'VTI', 'VTI', 'CAPE', 'IRA', 'IRA', 'SPY', 'LEAP', 'LEAP', 'VTI', 'VTI', 'VTI', 'LEAP', 'ETF', 'LEAP', 'LEAP', 'CAPE', 'CAPE', 'IRA', 'VTI', 'SPY']"

WHAT AM I MISSING $TTWO?? $600 PT - GTA 6 ANALYSIS (Take-Two Interactive),1n5i3sl,Pale_Tutor3883,2025-09-01 07:16:21,2,0.53,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n5i3sl/what_am_i_missing_ttwo_600_pt_gta_6_analysis/,"**Everyone keeps saying GTA 6 is ""priced in**"" at $232, but I think the market is massively underestimating the paradigm shift. My thesis: GTA 6 is becoming a platform like Roblox/Fortnite Creative. **I'm projecting $5B+ first year revenue** (vs analyst consensus of $3.2B), with **GTA Online 2.0 eventually generating $5B+ annually** through user-generated content. In 2028, Fortnite generated about $5.4 billion in revenue... GTA 6 online will be bigger than that. The console cycle timing is perfect and GTA V already proved this franchise has decade-long durability, still doing $700M+ annually after 11 years. **Add GTA+ subscriptions for sticky recurring revenue** and eventual PC/next-gen releases for cross-platform network effects.

What bear case am I missing? **Roblox trades at 12-13x FORWARD revenue**, Fortnite drove Epic to a $31B valuation. **If TTWO gets even a 10x multiple on $10-12B FY2027 revenue, we're looking at $600+ stock price.** The *FiveM acquisition* signals they're serious about UGC/creator tools. Current analysts seem stuck valuing this like a traditional game publisher ($3.2B one-time sales) instead of recognizing the platform transformation with recurring revenue streams. The 12-year wait plus next-gen console adoption curve could drive 50M+ sales in 6 months vs. Street expectations of 38-40M for the full year. **Am I delusional** or is the market just not seeing this Roblox/Fortnite-level opportunity?

And it's not just GTA carrying this thesis. TTWO's entire business is firing on all cylinders. **NBA 2K25 saw 48% YoY growth in recurrent spending**, and early impressions of 2K26 are glowing with fixed dribbling physics drawing praise from the community. **Borderlands 4 is already #6 on Steam's top wishlisted games with strong pre-order momentum** for September. Mobile revenue is resurging: Toon Blast grew 22% YoY, Match Factory hit record net bookings with 33% growth, and GTA+ subscribers jumped 35%. Latest earnings showed $1.35B revenue with 81% from recurrent consumer spending. *The whole portfolio is executing while we wait for GTA 6 to blow the doors off.*

**Here's what the market's missing** about recurring revenue: GTA Online 2.0 will be a subscription machine. With 5x the player base of GTA Online 1, **GTA+ subscriptions will absolutely explode.** This isn't just a one-time sales spike. Strauss Zelnick (CEO) has specifically said GTA 6 will ""set a new baseline"" for the business. They're not planning for a revenue bump that fades; they're building for sustained recurring revenue that will *dwarf the $700M+ annually that 11-year-old GTA Online still generates.* The Street thinks in quarters, but **TTWO is building a decade-long cash flow monster.**

Look, if GTA 6 sucks, this entire thesis is dead, but that's *betting against Rockstar's undefeated track record*. Their last game, Red Dead Redemption 2, is considered one of the greatest games ever made, and they haven't missed in 20+ years. I think it's more irrational to bet on them suddenly forgetting how to make games than to believe GTA 6 will deliver.

The same happened when Netflix was at 180, when people were saying Netflix cancelled too many shows therefore the company has a failing strategy.

I have the same feeling right now about Ubisoft, which has historically a very low market cap at 1.2 billion.  People seem to hate this company for personal reasons, same hate that EA (43 billion) and Activision got some time ago. Youtubers are making bank selling anti-woke Ubisoft hate.

Confused about reallocating wealth managed individual stock portfolio – need advice,1n4prbw,skyrim_replayer,2025-08-31 08:49:14,0,0.38,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n4prbw/confused_about_reallocating_wealth_managed/,"Hi,

I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with my investment strategy. I’d appreciate your perspective on whether to stay the course or reallocate.

**Current situation:**

* No debt, in between $500k and $1mil in annual income, recently received \~$200k and am now reconsidering my investment strategies (or lack thereof).
* \~$700k in a Citi wealth management brokerage account (a mix of individual stocks, not index funds). High AUM fee of 1%.
* The \~$200k in cash is sitting in a high-yield savings account
* Time horizon: 10 years, want to retire early
* Risk tolerance: high / aggressive. Will probably work to the extent I need if my portfolio is too low to retire in 5-10 years, so I think it's fine to remain aggressive with my time horizon.

**Concerns:**

* My brokerage account has grown since 2022, but I realized I would have done better just buying an S&P 500 index fund. I initially chose a wealth management account in 2022 when I graduated college and started working because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to handle a market downturn on my own. I'm not worried about that anymore.
* I don’t love holding so many individual stocks; it's going to be a nightmare to handle and I don't have time to do market research. But reallocating means paying capital gains tax.

**My plan for what to do before I drafted this up:**

* I just emailed my advisor and requested a call to move my holdings out and close the account. He's underperformed the S&P and the fee is unnecessary. I just am not sure about what to actually do with the holdings:
   * For the \~680k in equities: ???
      * Like mentioned above, I don't think it's worth reallocating and eating the capital gains taxes, but I'm stressed about having to manage all these individual stocks (see **Portfolio snapshot**)
       * Was going to just kill the ~20k in fixed income when I can
   * For the 200k sign-on bonus: easier situation. Planning to dollar cost average (over 8 weekly installments??) into mostly VOO and a bit of VT, thinking 95/5 or 90/10 split.

**Questions for you all:**

1. I’m unsure whether to:
   1. Keep the current portfolio “as is” (and maybe just move the $200k cash into index funds),
   2. Pick out some of these stocks to sell and convert into index funds
   3. Something hopefully smarter than either of those??
2. How would you approach reallocating from individual stocks to index funds in a tax-efficient way?
3. For the $200k cash, would you lump-sum into an index fund now or dollar-cost average over a few months?
4. If reallocating the $600k, what’s a smart time frame (all at once vs. over years)?

I know nobody can time the market or predict taxes perfectly, but I’d love to hear how more experienced investors would handle this situation. I’m aware I’m privileged to be in this position and want to make the smartest long-term choices possible.

Thanks in advance!

Recently, Trump launched another political attack against the dovish Fed Governor Cook. Even if we don’t think Cook will turn into a hawk, such blatant pressure would at least push him and other governors aligned with him to adopt a relatively more cautious stance.

After all, even if the Chair’s stance shifts, considering everything above, he doesn’t fully represent the views within the Fed. The final decision still comes down to the one-person-one-vote process during the meeting. So why does the market seem completely unresponsive to this?",2025-08-31,-0.8169,Negative,[]

* **SCHO (Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF):** Invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 years. This provides the most safety and lowest interest rate risk of the group (except SGOV), but with a lower potential yield. 
* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):** Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **TIPS (iShares TIPS Bond ETF)** generally performs well in an Inflationary environment as its principal and interest payments increase with inflation.
* ***SGOV*** **(iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF)** for people who want to park their money and earn an interest rate that is usually higher than a CD without the restrictions of waiting for maturity.

**What is your plan for the Bond ETFs with the upcoming probable rate cut?**

*The most sensitive one with the upcoming rate cut is probably* ***TLT***.

*On the opposite end, there is* ***SGOV*** *for the super conservative who wants to store money like in a bank account.*

**Yields from Treasury bonds** and other U.S. government securities are **subject to Federal tax but exempt from state and local income taxes.**",2025-08-30,0.9901,Positive,"['SCHO', 'ETF', 'SGOV', 'IEF', 'ETF', 'TLT', 'ETF', 'GOVT', 'ETF', 'TLT', 'TIPS', 'TIPS', 'ETF', 'SGOV', 'ETF', 'CD', 'TLT', 'SGOV']"

I’m trying to build a long-term core + satellite style portfolio and I’m stuck on one decision: what’s the best factor to pair with momentum?

Right now I’m leaning toward quality + momentum across all caps, since it feels like a more balanced approach and I don’t really want to mess with emerging markets too much.

But I also see arguments for value or even small-cap value as a counterweight to momentum. Historically, value has offset momentum pretty well, especially in drawdowns, but small-cap value tends to be more volatile and I’m not sure I want to add that kind of risk.

So the question is:

Does quality + momentum make sense as the “simpler” combo for an all-cap factor tilt?

Or is there a strong case to add value/small-cap value instead (or in addition)?

Dell (DELL) Tanks After Earnings: Is AI Growth Worth the Margin Hit?,1n3ey78,Optionslab,2025-08-29 18:16:14,5,0.78,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n3ey78/dell_dell_tanks_after_earnings_is_ai_growth_worth/,"Dell just showed us that AI growth is not always as smooth as it looks.

TL;DR: The stock fell almost 10 percent after earnings. Dell says AI server sales will double to 20 billion dollars by 2026, but those servers bring in less money per dollar sold, which is squeezing margins. PC growth also lagged behind HP. Big growth story, but profitability is the concern.

At first glance, Dell’s earnings looked solid. They beat on sales and profit, which normally would be a win. But the market focused on one thing: margins.

The big storyline was AI servers. Dell expects to sell about 20 billion dollars worth by 2026, double what they sold last year. That is huge growth and shows how central Dell is becoming to the AI hardware buildout. The catch is that AI servers only bring in margins in the mid-teens compared to the 20 to 30 percent range they get from traditional servers and storage. The more they sell, the less profitable each dollar becomes. We already saw that this quarter, with operating margins at 8.8 percent instead of the 10.3 percent Wall Street wanted.

The PC side was not much better. Dell’s PC sales were up just 1 percent, while HP posted 5 percent growth. That makes it look like Dell is slipping in that area. And in AI servers, they are not alone. Competitors like Super Micro are coming in fast and hungry.

To be fair, Dell is not falling apart. They still returned 1.3 billion dollars to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, they are handling tariff pressure well, and they see a deflationary outlook on input costs. The Windows 11 refresh could also give them some extra momentum.

So Dell is balancing two stories. On one side, there is a massive AI growth engine that could double sales. On the other side, that growth is putting pressure on margins while competition keeps getting tougher. The market clearly decided to focus on the downside this quarter.

Are investors being too harsh, or is Dell’s margin squeeze a real long-term problem?

> A key Fed-watched measure of inflation rose **as expected** in July, new government data showed Friday. The ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures index, closely studied by the central bank, rose 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.9% on an annual basis, above the Fed's 2% inflation target. Both numbers matched economist expectations, though **the annual pace marked the biggest rise since February.**

> Meanwhile, US consumer sentiment declined to a three-month low as consumers in a University of Michigan survey suggested **they expect inflation to surge over the next year.**

But, I don't think ""The Markets"" really cares about -inflation-.  Rather, increased inflation means less chance of a Fed rate cut, which is -really- what Mr Market wants to see.

In fact, in my role as Curmudgeon here, I'd say that for most of this year, eight months so far, any fundamental news is pooh-poohed in its own right, and ONLY given any value if it, two or three steps removed, increases the odds of ~~finding the Holy Grail~~ getting another rate cut.

Hidden Pressures and the Role of Real-World Asset Investments,1n32a8m,Fit_Negotiation_1207,2025-08-29 08:59:46,0,0.25,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n32a8m/hidden_pressures_and_the_role_of_realworld_asset/,"In investment markets, external pressures often take time before they are fully priced in. movements such as rising tariffs, changing monetary policies, or global supply disruptions rarely impact valuations immediately. Instead, they accumulate in silence until earnings reports or macroeconomic data confirm the extent of the effect. At that point, sentiment can shift sharply, leaving unprepared investors exposed.  
  
This dynamic is not limited to equities. Real world assets such as real estate, commodities, or government debt carry similar risks. Investors may treat them as stable stores of value, but the previous events shows that when structural costs rise or market conditions tighten, their repricing can be sudden. For this reason, portfolio strategies that rely too heavily on assumptions of stability often face the greatest shock.  
  
The evolution of investment products is beginning to address this challenge. Maybe using RWA like the ones from brokers or exchanges like bitget real world assets, index perpetual futures, illustrate how tokenization and blockchain based derivatives can provide more immediate reflections of traditional asset behavior. For investors, things like these can create an opportunity to track and hedge exposures with greater flexibility, rather than waiting for slower moving signals from quarterly reports.  
  
For long term strategy, the takeaway is clear. Investments should not be assessed only on current performance but also on hidden pressures that may surface later. Identifying these stress points early, and using innovative tools to monitor or hedge them, is increasingly central to managing risk. awareness of both traditional signals and modern instruments is becoming an essential part of the investment process.",2025-08-29,0.9834,Positive,['RWA']

Real estate investing that is helping the housing crisis while generating solid returns,1n2zurt,Interesting_Rush_166,2025-08-29 06:22:16,0,0.37,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n2zurt/real_estate_investing_that_is_helping_the_housing/,"
Been in real estate for about 10 years and ngl, started feeling pretty shitty about contributing to the housing crisis. Started looking into alternatives that could still make money but actually help people.

Room rentals for essential workers seem to be the sweet spot. You're providing housing at rates people can actually afford (like $150/week) while still seeing 15-20% returns. Way better than the 8% I was getting on traditional rentals.

The demand has been crazy - nurses, delivery drivers, warehouse workers all need basic housing near work. Found companies like padsplit that structure as public benefit corporations to balance profit with purpose.

The numbers work because you're solving an actual problem, not just squeezing people for max rent. Anyone else looking at impact investing in real estate? It feels good to make money without being part of the problem.",2025-08-29,0.965,Positive,[]

The stock is down 99% from 2021 highs, now a \~$150 million stub. Consensus presumes a terminal decline as students abandon subscriptions for ChatGPT.

The business reality is a bit different. While core “homework help” subscribers have halved, the company has adapted: 

* CheggMate integrates AI, reducing costs per user and preserving its differentiator of verified content. 
* Busuu, its language-learning platform, is growing 15% year-on-year (B2B up 39%) and expected profitable by 2026. 
* Skills, its certifications business, is growing double digits and should also break even in 2026. 
* Management has removed $165–175 million in annualized costs, bringing adjusted EBITDA to $23 million in Q2 despite halved revenue. Balance sheet shows net cash (\~$52 million) and no solvency risk.

Chegg trades below the price it paid for Busuu alone ($436 million in 2022). At today’s \~$1.40, investors assign zero value to Busuu, Skills, or any optionality. A modest re-rating to reflect Busuu at even 3x sales implies upside multiples of the current equity. Strategic alternatives are actively being pursued, including a go-private. A $3–5/share takeout is plausible, representing 2–4x from here.

Of course there are risks. The subscription base may continue to erode, AI products may fail to differentiate, and competition from free alternatives could worsen. But with net cash and positive adjusted profitability, liquidation is unlikely.

Yet, CHGG is mispriced as an “AI casualty.” In reality, it is a shrinking core business with emerging growth assets and optionality around a sale. Downside is largely exhausted.

I have painstakingly collected PIT for one market, each day, for 20 years, and found it very useful,  but I do not have this for most markets. Inquries of many data providers provided no joy in this respect.

Abstract

We provide data and code that successfully reproduces nearly all cross-
sectional stock return predictors. Our 319 characteristics draw from pre-
vious meta-studies, but we differ by comparing our t-stats to the original
papers’ results. For the 161 characteristics that were clearly significant in
the original papers, 98% of our long-short portfolios find t-stats above 1.96.
For the 44 characteristics that had mixed evidence, our reproductions find
t-stats of 2 on average. A regression of reproduced t-stats on original long-
short t-stats finds a slope of 0.90 and an R 2 of 83%. Mean returns are mono-
tonic in predictive signals at the characteristic level. The remaining 114
characteristics were insignificant in the original papers or are modifica-
tions of the originals created by Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2020). These remain-
ing characteristics are almost always significant if the original characteristic
was also significant.",2025-08-28,0.9928,Positive,"['PIT', 'PIT', 'PIT', 'PIT', 'PIT']"

I'd post in one of the various dividend-oriented subs, but they want to keep their safe space free of common sense. Attached link shows a chart with four series: SCHD total return, SPY total return, SCHD price return (dividends taken), and SPY total return less 3% withdrawal (simulating selling to raise income). SPY beats SCHD in both scenarios. 

Qualified dividends and long term capital gains are taxed generally at the same rates (at the US Federal level), so there is no advantage to dividends from a tax perspective. Commissions and fees are zero in this era, so no benefit from a transaction fee perspective. It seems that the only benefits to receiving dividends over selling to raise is psychological or behavioral. A dividend investor is making the choice (knowingly or not) that company management are better at choosing how much of your investment to sell and return.

Here's a couple:

Break even hard stop loss: you don't lose money when you are wrong on the trade, but you get stopped  tons of times making the process tedious.

Short hard stop loss 2% below entry point. Pros you keep alive on trading a little longer, and risk is not that high. When trades go wrong 2% is not a crazy amount to lose.

Hard stop loss on 5% makes more room to price to correct and you stay longer in trades, but you lose 5% each time you are wrong.

Generous 6 to 10% stop loss will keep you in the game most of times but is hard to accept 10% loses

Been trying to make sense of some conflicting signals after Powell's Jackson Hole comments and the recent tech earnings.

The market seems torn between Fed dovishness (89% chance of September cut now vs 72% before) and what feels like a reality check on AI valuations. NVIDIA beat on revenue but missed datacenter expectations, and despite solid fundamentals, the stock suffered a small setback but was able to recover quickly. Same with CrowdStrike posting 21% revenue growth, first falling on ""mixed"" guidance and then immediately rose above the initial level again.

Meanwhile, rate sensitive sectors like small caps and financials are rallying on the Powell speech. The whole ""lower rates benefit both growth duration and cyclical leverage"" dynamic is playing out in real time, but I'm wondering if we're just seeing small tactical rotation rather than a real style shift.

What's making this tricky is that fundamentally, the AI infrastructure spending still looks robust, and these mega caps are printing cash at levels that make traditional value metrics seem irrelevant. But everyone's calling this the big rotation moment.

Are others seeing this as a genuine long term shift toward value, or more like a minor recalibration of growth expectations? Curious how people are positioning between quality growth that can justify valuations vs cyclicals that benefit from easier monetary policy.

One of the stocks (Microsoft) has done far better than all of the rest, so now something like 20.4% of my investments are in Microsoft (which is not how it was when I started).

* Rooftop solar carrier with \~1,100 watts capacity

* Reported $7M in pre-orders with 2,000+ reservations
* 175,000 customers worldwide across prior products
* Team includes solar and EV veterans with prior exits

The product is still in pre-production, but the company is running a Regulation Crowdfunding campaign to help fund development.

**Bearish View:** The product isn’t commercially available yet. Manufacturing and scaling hardware is tough, competition in EV charging is fierce, and adoption depends heavily on consumer behavior and geography.

Around last year at 22 years old my dad helped me set up an account with American century since that is who he uses. I put 4,000 dollars into their ultra (TWCUX) and 4,000 into their select fund (TWCIX). I recently moved the money into their capital preservation fund (CPFXX). It is currently sitting at 8,313 dollars. After doing my own research after a few months I have learned about their expense ratios being much higher after not knowing much about things like this before investing. I just opened a individual brokerage account and roth ira account with fidelity because that is who I want to use moving forward. My question is how would I go about moving the money in American century over to the roth ira specifically (I will be adding other money into the brokerage account later). It has been less than a year so I assume it would be smart to wait till around November to quality for long term capital gains? Then would it be smart to sell the funds with American century and just buy with fidelity or is there a better way of transferring them into fidelity while still dropping American century?

It sounds like this would save me money in the long run but I could use some advice. Thanks!

Edit: or could I stop contributing to NWM, open a fidelity and contribute to that, then eventually roll the NWM into fidelity fee free. But my balance there still loses money to the fees. Which I believe is around 1.84% annually. But I could be way off base

I've decided to try something different and vibe-coded a portfolio management system. It's basically an LLM with a bunch of tools to design a portfolio for you according to your investment goal. I've been test-driving it for about 6 weeks, and here are my results so far.

The goal was to build a moderate risk portfolio with some crypto exposure.

Initially it gave me this:

MSFT 5%  
BND 10%  
ICLN 5%  
QQQ 10%  
SCHD 10%  
VNQ 5%  
VTI 25%  
VXUS 15%  
ETH-USD, BTC-USD 5% each

it went about 4% up so far. I got a little lucky with massive jump in ETH, at which point it suggested to rotate some of the profits into SGOV/BND, and reduce crypto exposure in general, so I'm down to about 6% crypto total.

ICLN was a little surprising as a recommendation, considering the political climate, but it paid off so far, up about 7%. 

Probably lucky timing as well, since the market was up in general. Actually the only losing investment was BTC-USD, down about 5%.

On paper, it looks like exactly the kind of boring, underfollowed industrial I’d normally love. Zero debt, $1B in cash, a century-old operator in copper tubes/fittings/brass rod, steady buybacks, dividend growth, and management that (to their credit) seems pretty rational.

The stock’s been a monster too: up 500%+ over the last decade. 

I passed because:

# #1 Margins look juiced

Gross margins went from the high teens pre-2020 to \~28–29% recently. Net margins quadrupled. 

But Mueller uses FIFO accounting. They churn inventory in about 2 months. When copper is rising, they’re selling at today’s high prices but booking costs from copper bought two months earlier. That lag makes margins look way fatter than they’d be in “normal” times.

It’s basically a copper cycle story dressed up as margin expansion. History says their long-term gross margin is closer to the mid-teens. My base case assumes it normalizes around 23–24%. Better than history, but nowhere near 28%.

# #2 Valuation math

If you buy into today’s margins, yeah, the stock is cheap. But if you assume reversion (like I do), fair value is closer to $109/share. That’s \~16% upside from here, not enough for me to size it as a high-conviction bet.

# To be fair…

Management has been solid. They bought Nehring (electrical wire/cable), which plugs them into the electrification/grid upgrade theme. They leaned into buybacks when the stock dipped, cutting share count by 3 million in just a few quarters. Dividends’s up too.

So I’m not knocking the business. It’s well run, and it might keep grinding higher if copper stays strong.

# Why I passed

The easy money’s been made. Margins this fat don’t last forever in a commodity-driven business. If copper prices cool or housing demand stays soft, earnings could undershoot, and that 28% margin will slide back toward something less magical.

I’d happily take another look in the $60s, or if the market resets its expectations. But at $90+, the risk/reward just doesn’t stack up for me.

Hi everyone,

I’m based in the Netherlands and I’m thinking about investing either €2,500 or €5,000 in total. I want to keep things relatively safe, with a focus on ETFs. I drafted a potential allocation and would love your feedback.

Goal: Long-term, stable growth with some defensive positioning.

Proposed Allocation:

ETF	Allocation	Notes
VWRL	30%	Global exposure, broad diversification
IWDA	20%	Focus on developed markets
WEBG	20%	Low-cost global exposure
IAD	15%	Defensive & ESG-focused
Bonds ETF	15%	Stability and income

Questions:
	1.	Does this allocation make sense for a conservative long-term investor?
	2.	Should I consider adjusting percentages or adding other ETFs for more safety?
	3.	Any tips for someone investing from the Netherlands regarding taxes, fees, or brokers?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

This is sparking major concerns about Fed independence, causing the dollar to sell off, and contributing to a steepening Treasury yield curve as September rate cut expectations rise.

Hey everyone,

A really significant development is unfolding that could have major implications for the markets: President Trump is moving to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of falsifying mortgage documents. Cook, however, has stated she will not resign, disputes the president's authority to remove her, and her legal team is prepared to take action.

This situation immediately raises critical questions about the direction of Fed policy and, more broadly, the independence of the Federal Reserve from political influence. Litigation is likely to center on whether the president can establish 'cause' for firing a Fed board member, which is a high bar.

The market reaction has been swift:

* The Dollar Sold Off: Following the news, the dollar weakened, with the Eurodollar strengthening to $1.16. Haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc saw decent bids, reflecting increased uncertainty.
* Treasury Yield Curve Steepening: We're seeing the US Treasury yield curve steepen, with the back end selling off (yields up, benchmark ten-year around 4.30%) and the front end seeing money move in (yields down). This steepening is partly driven by expectations of a September rate cut by the Fed, but also by concerns about Fed independence contributing to selling pressure on longer-dated Treasuries.

A potential shift in the Fed's balance of power could reshape US monetary policy direction at a time of global instability, rising debt, and potential inflation. Gold and other hard assets are even being recommended as diversifiers in this environment.

The reason I make this point is that EPS is growing at a faster rate relative to the historical average P/E ratio. Note: the historical data I’m referencing dates back to 1926.

The average P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is **17.97**.  
The average EPS growth rate of the S&P 500 is about **5.5–6% per year**.  
The current P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is **27.28**.  
The EPS growth rate of the S&P 500 since the second quarter is **12%**.

So, if we equalize the P/E ratio relative to EPS growth with how fast companies are expanding, the P/E ratio could rise as high as **35.82**, given today’s growth rates.

The reason I find this a compelling argument and why I believe it applies is that companies are not valued only on their present earnings, but also on their future potential. In today’s market, which is driven by quarter-to-quarter news, as long as EPS growth continues at this pace, a P/E of 27.28 is absolutely justifiable given historical data.

NOTE: It is possible for my numbers to be wrong since I am relying on Google AI Search, ChatGPT deep research, and historical charts.

Background:I still live at home. So, therefore, someone at my house works at Merrill Lynch as a covered person. Thus, I was enrolled in ML for a few years against my will. 

I have a rollover IRA from my old employer sitting at Merrill Lynch. It’s all in index funds FTEC and SPLG mainly, which basically mirrors my current company 401k. I have no plans on selling FTEC (bought 200~ shares at $38 back then), but I won’t mind getting rid of SPLG just because it’s under $10k and won’t mind getting a micro cap fund or something that pays heavy capital gains. ML is so archaic or limited from me buying from banking regulations or astronomical fees on the ML side. However, I found out I can open a Fidelity account. But I rather keep my money at ML to get free banking at BofA.

Don’t care what the consensus is on the changes they’re making to Cracker Barrel. That’s not the story. 

Nope. Instead, it’s the valuation of the company. Is it any good? 

2 years ago, CBRL was priced above $130/share. Today, it sits around $50. How did this happen? Surely it’s not the rebranding at fault. Their valuation has already been in decline. 

Inflation happened. Low revenue growth and higher turnover happened. Cracker Barrel’s EBIT margin easily floated around 8-9%. Now a days, they’re lucky to eke out 4%, making them half as profitably. 

These pains in the cost drivers, of course, are temporary. 
History has shown that the commodity price impacts on their menu eventually work themselves out with the broader market accepting price hikes. 
Same store growth is still a problem. Their revenue is not growing as quickly as the industry peers. CBRL has been wallowing in the 1-2% revenue growth mud pit for years.

That said, I don’t suspect this is the end. The new rollout of the layout changes will take place in select restaurants first, if their efforts to generate public interest are met with the market equalizing the operating costs to what their historical averages are, this could turn the company around nearly overnight. 
I don’t see it taking many positive earnings reports to send the message. 

When holding all things the same in terms of scale for Cracker Barrel, I took the time to model what 5% revenue growth and a 7% EBIT margin would mean for the company’s valuation. A couple trials with my model put the present value of CBRL at $100-108/share. In even more conservative scenario analysis, where growth stayed at 2% and margins improved, the company can still be reasonably valued around $75-80/share. 

Lastly, I’d like to say that there’s no such thing as bad publicity. How many Cracker Barrel’s were full over the weekend just to take in some last minute nostalgia and make a silent protest to the change? 

Getting a jump on earnings for just one quarter, despite it having nothing to do with the actual rollout of their branding redesign, could still convince the market that the changes were all positive and therefor continue to gain positive feedback from the public. 

TLDR: I bought CBRL and you might also want to. ",2025-08-26,0.9902,Positive,"['CBRL', 'EBIT', 'CBRL', 'EBIT', 'CBRL', 'TLDR', 'CBRL']"

Hope all is well. So, for health insurance purposes, I need to figure out what my monthly income is EVERY month and report it. Naturally things like interest from the bank or anything i would make from a job would be countable income. I was not aware that certain things in a brokerage account would count for income. I don't know what i'm looking at each month i get my statement. For the most part, I simply see if it was more or less than last month. Obviously, that's unwise and I'm going tom change that. Based on somebody's comment in another group, .... -Income is interest, dividends, realized gains.

I thought there would be a number that says realized gains? and a total, but i don't see it.I see ""unrealized g/l"".. I wish this was like a bank.. I see how much interest I gained this month very easily,lol.

So, ANY feedback would be appreciated because as In said I don't know what I'm looking at.

Thank you

I’m 27M, PR in Canada. In April I bought my first condo in Scarborough, ON. To make the purchase I used up basically all my savings (~$130K for 20% down + closing costs).  

Current situation:  
- Wife is studying RPN, will be working full-time next year, so our income would increase from next year April/May hopefully
- 3 months emergency fund saved.  
- Income: $9K–10K/month after tax (main job + side hustle).  
- Work benefit: 4% RRSP match (~$10K/year for now).  
- Investing: No non-registered investments, most TFSA/RRSP room available.  
- Lifestyle: We love travelling and want to keep it in the budget. 
- Company bonus - upto 10k, should I directly invest that or add that as lump sum payment to condo?

I’m basically restarting my investing journey after buying the condo.  

Questions:  
1. Should I build my emergency fund more before investing?  
2. Prioritize TFSA, RRSP (beyond the match), or mix?  
3. How much can I reasonably spend on travel each year without slowing wealth building too much?  
4. Any strategies you’d recommend for getting back into investing post-home purchase?  

Thanks!

Investing strategies for an 24 year old,1n04ss1,TrashTheGreat,2025-08-25 22:29:44,3,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1n04ss1/investing_strategies_for_an_24_year_old/,"I graduated college about a year ago, and after getting a handle on my student loans, I started focusing on investing. Earlier this year, I joined my company’s ESPP program, and I’ve been learning a lot along the way. For context, I bring home about $4k/month after taxes, insurance, HCFSA, 401k, and ESPP contributions. I didn’t grow up in a family with much financial knowledge or stability, so I’ve been navigating everything on my own with the help of this subreddit and other resources. I feel like I’m making progress, but I’d love to hear advice/criticism to make sure I’m on the right track. One area I’m still trying to fully understand is taxes, specifically, whether capital gains (short vs long term) only apply when I sell or if they also apply while my money is sitting in an account.

Here’s what I’m doing now:

ESPP: My company lets employees buy shares every six months at a 15% discount, based on either the first or last day of the offering period. Shares are then automatically enrolled in the DRIP program, so dividends get reinvested into more stock. Last cycle I was able to buy at $79/share, and now it’s at $164/share. I know it’s not ideal to be too concentrated in one stock, but I’ve been riding it out so far and I’m not sure if I should sell when I get my next shares in Jan 2026. (Company is Seagate if that matters.)

401k (Roth): I contribute 6% and my employer matches 6%. I originally chose the Vanguard 2065 Target Retirement Fund but recently switched to VANG INST 500 IDX TR (an S&P 500 index fund) because I wanted to take a more aggressive approach while I’m young. As I get older, I’ll slowly shift some into bonds for stability. Though, I wasn’t sure if I should look into other assets like foreign stock and short term on top of it.

Brokerage (short term goals): I put at least $1k/month here for things like a future down payment on a house, wedding/honeymoon, and emergency fund. Right now I’m in USFR since it’s state and local tax free, fairly liquid (3–5 days to withdraw), and fits my shorter timeline.

On a personal note, my boyfriend makes good money too, but I want to stay financially independent. I saw what happened to my mom when she had to rely on someone else, and I don’t want to repeat that.

Would love to hear your thoughts on whether I’m approaching this the right way, and any feedback on taxes, diversification, or strategy. Appreciate any input!

My reasoning was, with $30,000 I can never throw up or fill with which I am going to retire. Therefore, I’m basically going to be all on black. And not worry about it. I can either do really well or or the complete opposite. And I was OK with losing the whole 30,000 if it came to it. By the time I finished my research, I had settled on a selection of stocks. Fast-forward eight years, and those picks have become a $650,000 portfolio.

Tesla 20%

The rest distributed among these
Amazon
Apple

Today, I’m 52 years old and believe it’s time to plan for retirement, which I hope will be in about 10 years. I have mostly left these stocks untouched over the years, though I have rebalanced slightly. For the most part, it's the same portfolio.
I don’t think it’s sustainable for me to stay with something this aggressive at my age, but I have no idea where to go from here. My Nvidia stock is up 27x, and everything else has at least doubled. I was offered a managed portfolio with all the bells and whistles (tax strategy, etc.) for an annual fee of 0.89%.
Everything I read back when I did my research advised against my choices, and a lot of advice today would still argue against it. But I can’t deny that if I had listened, my portfolio would probably be one-fifth of what it is today.
Does anyone have any advice on what to do next? My retirement goal is 2035.

Trying to overhaul my IRA and taxable brokerage account with a focus on AI divestment,1mypdyp,dragnmastr85,2025-08-24 07:38:05,19,0.7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mypdyp/trying_to_overhaul_my_ira_and_taxable_brokerage/,"I’m looking for a gut-check on a simple plan. I have an IRA (\~$80k) and a taxable brokerage (\~$267k) with Morgan Stanley. Both are managed accounts. Right now about 60% of the portfolio equity is effectively tied to big tech/AI (mag7). I’d like to cut that concentration, move to a fund-only setup, and keep costs low. Also somewhat of a hedge towards AI bubble burst.

Target mix (household level)

* 75% U.S. large cap
   * 50% core (S&P 500 or total market: VOO/VTI or equivalents)
   * 25% “top-7 light” allocation to reduce reliance on AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA (leaning XMAG; open to RSP if that’s cleaner)
* 25% diversifiers
   * 10% value (VTV or IWD)
   * 5% mid cap (VO or IJH)
   * 4% small cap (VB or IJR)
   * 6% international (VXUS or IXUS)

How I’d implement

* IRA: start with XMAG only (no S&P/total market in IRA) to cut the mega-cap tilt fast with no tax hit. 
* Taxable: keep the S&P/total-market core (VOO/VTI) and systematically exit all single-stock positions, prioritizing the big tech names first. Do it tax-sensitively with about $10–15k per year in realized gains, have dividends go to cash to fund the new ETFs, and aim to finish in roughly three years.

My rationale for this vs just holding S&P 500?

* Keeps broad U.S. exposure but dials down single-name risk.
* XMAG (or equal-weight) helps with the current top-heavy market.
* The diversifier slice is pretty boilerplate imo. 

Questions:

1. Does this combo (core + XMAG + value/mid/small/international) seem like a sensible way to cut big-tech exposure? Not a full divestment (though I'd like to - it's too risky of a bet), but a reduction in overexposure.
2. For placement, would you park value/mid/small in the IRA and leave international in taxable for the foreign tax credit, or is that not worth optimizing?
3. Is \~$10–15k per year in realized gains and a \~3-year glidepath a reasonable way to unwind single stocks in taxable?
4. End stage I'd like to remove the ""managed"" signifier from these two accounts entirely. Has anyone had luck asking for a reduced brokerage fee or flat/retainer model for the advisors? How would you recommend I broach this full strategy with them?
5. Should I deploy something similar with my 403b (if the available funds allow)?
6. Anything else I'm missing?",2025-08-24,0.9716,Positive,"['IRA', 'AI', 'AI', 'VOO', 'VTI', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'NVDA', 'META', 'TSLA', 'XMAG', 'RSP', 'VTV', 'IWD', 'VO', 'IJH', 'VB', 'IJR', 'VXUS', 'IXUS', 'IRA', 'XMAG', 'IRA', 'VOO', 'VTI', 'XMAG', 'XMAG', 'IRA']"

My analysis is based only on technicals, so you won't find anything related to the fundamental of the Company.

[$AAPL 12M Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qd76QvMN/) \- This is the highest timeframe we have access to and we don't need anything else.  
Bias is super bullish since price is trending nicely above the EMAs (5-10-20).

[$AAPL 10W Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/q1qZ0bMf/) \- In the 10W chart, we can see price sweeping below the 20 EMA (green one). That is usually a sign that an [Accumulation](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tUSS3XGd/) is taking place. Since we are taking in consideration Wyckoff cycles for this analysis, someone could argue that, currently, we are in a [Re-accumulation 2](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ocRH2uyi/) instead of in a new forming cycle. That could be true because both are valid, it depends on how we decide to see charts. Anyway, price is showing bullishness

[$AAPL 1W Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6w2dPABd/) \- In the Weekly chart, the price has just come out of an accumulation and currently it's possible we are about to form the first Re-accumulation. I'm expecting price to form at least another indecision candle (whether it will be an inside candle or a lower candle that hits the 5 or 10 EMA) to confirm a solid re-accumulation. If price manages to break that high (black line) it is very likely that price will reach another ATH in 3-6 months

This is not financial advice, obviously.  
Just want to share with you what I see on the charts

Have moved around to different jobs, and developed 401(k)s with three different companies, including the one I'm currently at. I also have a separate Roth IRA that I contribute to annually. 

I never rolled over my 401(k) accounts from one company when I left. I always just left them to keep generating interest. But, am now trying to decide if I should, and if it's worthwhile. My initial thought was that, generally speaking, I should keep my retirement savings in a company 401(k), if allowed, instead of transferring to a private account, because they company is going to be able to negotiate better management fees with the investment firm than I could, and thus, save me money over all. Not sure.

Anyway, I've been looking at the rates of return on the various retirement accounts that I have for my prior jobs, and my IRA. I looked at the rate of return from January 1, 2022, until today. I assume, for my questions, that the investment strategy for each of these funds is the same, or, at the very least, comparable, such that the risk is not materially different. 

One prior 401(k) seems to be performing slightly worse than the others. It had an annualized rate of return of \~5.25%, and a cumulative of \~20.5% from January 1, 2022, until today. My other prior job's 401(k) indicated a cumulative rate of return of 28.7% during that time period. The IRA had an annualized rate of return of 6.5%. 

Should these numbers inform my decision to move accounts, at all? Are these numbers just general variance, or can I infer that a \~1.25% total rate of return loss over the course of three and a half years, (and and/or a total difference of 8% over that time), is significant such that I rollover that account?

As a followup, is it generally better to roll a prior 401k into a current company account, or create a separate account with the same company that currently has my IRA? My current company's 401(k) is doing relatively well, even compared to my other accounts, but it does not have a long history. ",2025-08-24,0.9244,Positive,"['IRA', 'IRA', 'IRA', 'IRA']"

Nvidia Launches Spectrum-XGS: What This Means for AI & Data Center Investing,1mxcbrk,jcbodeya,2025-08-22 17:10:46,25,0.86,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mxcbrk/nvidia_launches_spectrumxgs_what_this_means_for/,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced on Friday its **Spectrum-XGS Ethernet**, designed to support data centers and AI super-factories. In late-morning trading, NVDA shares rose 1.7% on the news.

Here’s why this matters for investors:

* **AI Super-Factories & Data Centers**: Spectrum-XGS is designed to allow data centers to scale beyond their individual buildings. Nvidia calls it the **“third pillar” of AI computing**, complementing vertical and horizontal scaling. Essentially, it enables massive AI infrastructures across cities, countries, and even continents.
* **Performance & Efficiency**: The platform integrates with Nvidia’s Spectrum-X, automatically adjusting networks, controlling congestion, latency, and telemetry. Nvidia claims performance nearly **twice that of their Collective Communications Library (NCCL)**.
* **Enterprise Adoption**: Hyperscale companies like **CoreWeave (CRWV)** are already testing the tech, connecting their data centers to Spectrum-XGS Ethernet. Early adoption by industry leaders can indicate strong future demand.
* **Earnings Context**: Nvidia will report next-quarter earnings **after market close on August 27**, with analysts projecting **EPS of $1.01** and **revenue of $46B**.

**Investor Takeaways**:  
For long-term investors, this reinforces Nvidia’s positioning in AI infrastructure, beyond GPUs. The launch highlights continued growth potential in data center and AI markets. It may also influence investment strategies in other hyperscale tech companies and cloud infrastructure providers.",2025-08-22,0.9363,Positive,"['NVDA', 'XGS', 'AI', 'NVDA', 'AI', 'XGS', 'AI', 'AI', 'NCCL', 'CRWV', 'XGS', 'EPS', 'AI', 'AI']"

For short-term investing, I still think going all in on the Nasdaq is risky considering 2000–2015 stretch was pretty rough. Mixing in the S&P 500 and even some bonds makes sense.

But how about money you won’t touch for 30–40 years, like retirement funds, wouldn’t an all-Nasdaq approach be better? 

I saw massive drop during bubble or the global financial crisis, but it always seems to recover and hit new highs. When the market’s booming, it just explodes upward.

And looking ahead, the future seems even more tech-driven(AI, humanoid robots). That makes me think the Nasdaq’s growth potential could be even bigger.

What is a price channel and what makes it valid?,1mwtj8f,Chartstradamus,2025-08-22 01:37:53,0,0.27,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mwtj8f/what_is_a_price_channel_and_what_makes_it_valid/,"As a TA trader many see my charts and don't understand how or why ""a couple of lines drawn on a chart"" would have any effect on the market.

It may sound simplistic... but when it comes down to it all a channel comes down to is the path the market takes to reaching market participants price targets.

Let me explain.

When a channel is in play there is a consensus among market participants of a certain price target for the market, by a certain period.  This could be a news event, earnings release, a point of significance for the particular instrument you are trading.

This gives you an x and y coordinate, a price and place in time.  And a channel is simply the path the market takes from its current point in time to reach that point.

At the base of the channel market participants are made to question the validity of that price target and support it if they do, bouncing the market and keeping the channel valid.  

If not resulting in a break of the channel, consolidation (re-evaluation of the price target) and a new channel structure targeting that new level.

While at the top of a channel they are presented with a similar question, if the price target is still valid market participants will likely exit being that they have already achieved a lions share of the move and given the timeframe may be able to get back in for another move toward the target area.  

Or if the price target is no longer valid and market participants agree it needs to be increased, the channel will break to the top side, consolidate and a new steeper channel structure will develop targeting the new price target.

Would you write a investing journal?,1mwrie3,soulplay_app,2025-08-22 00:04:42,22,0.89,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mwrie3/would_you_write_a_investing_journal/,"Over the years I’ve noticed a frustrating pattern in my own investing: I remember the trades that worked out, but I often forget the reasoning behind the ones that didn’t. Months later I’ll look at a stock and think, *“Why did I even buy this? What was I expecting?”,* and I realize I’m not really learning from my own decisions.

That got me thinking: maybe the only way to truly get better as an investor is to keep a proper journal, not just numbers in a spreadsheet, but a record of my thought process.

That’s why I started wondering: what if there were a proper investing journal app?

The idea is:

* You write down *why* you bought (or sold) a stock, your thesis, expectations, and risks.
* Later, the app reminds you to revisit those notes after earnings or major events so you can reflect.
* It automatically shows how the stock performed since your note (price changes, key events).
* AI can help pull in relevant news, filings, or earnings reports that match what you wrote, so your thesis is always grounded in real data.
* You can share your journals/trades with other people so you can share ideas and get feedback.

For me, the point is to actually get better as an investor over time by reflecting on past reasoning, not just looking at a chart.

\- Do you already track your decisions like this?  
\- Would you actually use an app that makes it easier to *remember, review, and learn* from your past investment thinking?

I’d love your honest feedback, even if your answer is “no, I’d just stick with spreadsheets.” Please leave a comment!",2025-08-22,0.99,Positive,['AI']
"AI stocks offered more returns than labor, and that’s why Altman is saying AI is a bubble",1mwqzki,FantasticEffect10,2025-08-21 23:41:06,0,0.23,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mwqzki/ai_stocks_offered_more_returns_than_labor_and/,"


I believe Sam Altman saying AI is a bubble is very concerning. Why would he even say that?
If he is the ceo of an AI company, wouldn’t that statement negatively affect its earnings?

The shift in the narrative from AI will replace white-collar workers to AI is a bubble feels very suspicious.

AI is extremely useful and one of the greatest inventions, but there’s a problem.

Chips and AI companies have been seen as a safe bet for investors. For example, nvidia stock has recently increased by around 30% in just one month. That’s essentially a guaranteed profit. Of course, Ceos and institutions don’t like this, because when people see AI stocks as a safe bet, they can just invest and earn consistent returns without working.

 If investing in AI stocks could reliably give you 30% profit every month, capitalism itself would face a problem. People wouldn’t need to work they could simply live off their investments. But capitalism relies on uncertainty and market swings to keep people working. They will lose money and they will need to come back to work.

Altman calling AI a bubble is not the truth. They are still developing AGI, and it will likely succeed. But when ceos say AI is a bubble, it gives institutional investors a reason to sell off and create panic. Ordinary people lose their money, while the big investors buy back at lower prices.

For example: if you invested $100 000 in AI stocks recently, you could have earned about  $30 000 in a single month. No regular job including high paying ones like doctors pays that much monthly. That kind of wealth creation threatens the system.

So, what happened? They artificially crash stocks by spreading fear, making ordinary people doubt AI and sell. This ensures that capitalism remains intact and prevents regular people from getting rich too easily.

That’s why Altman saying AI is a bubble feels shady. He’s the ceo of an AI company, yet he released a weaker version of gpt5 that showed little improvementpossibly to justify his words.

The reality is AI is still a safe bet.
The real problem is that investing in AI companies gives people more profit than traditional labor. If people can earn more from AI stocks than from working corporate jobs, they no longer need to work. This threatens the entire system. So, ceos and institutions are trying to build uncertainty, cut down ordinary people’s gains, and keep them tied to traditional labor.

But after this fake manipulation, the wave of AI will continue.

However, I am also wondering if I should take some time to research other stock picks with good growth opportunity/increase my positions in some of the individual stocks I own already.

In my head it would be advantageous to claim more of the gain on her income due to tax brackets getting us an effectively lower tax rate.

My question is this even legal to do and if it's not how would the government even determine who gets what portion of the gains. If my wife and I have a joint checking that shares both our direct deposits how can anyone state who made the contribution.

Another hypothetical where this could be taken more advantage of same idea but wife quits working for a year. We then decided to sell for the full 100k gain and now she's much lower effective tax rate.

Geopolitical tensions are ramping up – escalating US-China trade conflicts, nearby military issues, and mercantilist policies. Add an ageing workforce that's less dynamic than America's, and it's clear: Europe needs strategies to stay competitive.

No quick fixes here. CEOs should focus on efficiency: spin off underperformers, dive into AI, and adopt smarter management practices. It's about boosting asset turnover to drive value in a changing world.

Policymakers can help too – by promoting mergers among mid-market firms, ramping up R&D incentives, and pushing for deeper market integration. This could redistribute resources to the best hands.

The era of easy leverage, strong margins, and global liberalism is fading. The new game? Pure efficiency. If Europe nails this, its companies might just close the gap with the US – and keep capital markets thriving in an ""America-First"" era.

Understanding dividend payout of SGOV,1mw1f0c,kuriousaboutanything,2025-08-21 04:38:49,4,0.6,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mw1f0c/understanding_dividend_payout_of_sgov/,"Hey folks,

I couldn't grasp how the SGOV's dividend pay works after reading through various subs. So, I have this understanding that SGOV, as an ETF, holds US treasury which is more or less safe, at least in the sense that we can get our principal investment without any losses (upto 250k FDIC insurance). But I am still confused what happens if I invest and (a) withdraw before the 3 month period, (b) end of the 3  month period.

As an example,  
1. lets say, I put $1000 into SGOV on my Schwab account on Aug 1, and I withdraw on day 90, lets say, Oct 30 Assuming there is a 5% payout, could someone explain if my understanding is correct?

5% of 1000 is $50, but that's for a year. So, I should get 50/4 = $12.5 at the end of the 90 day?

More questions:  
2. What happens if I purchase on Aug 30 (when the SGOV would have already spent 30 days). Would the price of the ETF have increased by now, and I would only get the dividend for the 60 days?

3. What if I purchase on Oct 29 (when the price of SGOV is highest) but sell it 10 days later? Won't I lose my principal?

4. How to find out when the SGOV day 0 starts? ",2025-08-21,0.7439,Positive,"['SGOV', 'SGOV', 'ETF', 'US', 'FDIC', 'SGOV', 'SGOV', 'ETF', 'SGOV', 'SGOV']"

Chartstradamus here with your daily TA update. Moving forward I am going to simplify things by covering ES, Gold, and Oil in a single post.

I'll only be covering the lower timeframes that are relevant to the days movements, if you'd like a more thorough rundown I breakdown all of the timeframes every weekend in my weekend updates.

ES: 
Weekend Update https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/s/RqmROPsDGH

We missed a fill in yesterdays long by just a few points and market rebounded significantly. I used to find these misses painful, but I've learn to realise it is simply a part of playing the markets edges like this.

Todays selloff and rebound provides us with new 15m structure for both the bears and bulls.

For a long I will be looking to this new structure with an entry around 6390 stop placement at 6350 outside of structure and under the swing low targeting confluence at 6470 R:R 2

For a short entry I will be looking to the 6470 area at the extremes of the new structure and sell area of the 1H bear structure stop placed outside of structure and passed ATH at 6510 targeting confluence at 6390 R:R 2

Gold: 
Weekend Update https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/s/eXkDMdmSni

Another rough miss on Gold, todays high was less than a point away from yesterdays short entry. Luckily the market consolidated up and finished on highs so we did not miss out on much.

Todays pump allows us to identify new Purple 15m bull structure. Market is trending up into the extremes of the 15m bear structure.

For a long I will wait for this new structure around 3370 with stop placed outside the new structure and under the swing low at 3350 targeting confluence at 3405 R:R 1.75

For a short we will wait to the extremes of the current 15m bear structure and 1H entry area at 3405 with stop placed at 3425 targeting confluence at 3370 R:R 1.75

Oil: 
Weekend Update https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/s/4HayJ5FJfM

Yesterdays Oil long played out beautifully.  We caught our entry within a few points of the market bottom and followed the market up all day just short of our target.

Yesterdays bounce means the Purple 15m channel has gone stale and needs to be redrawn.  The market is now in the breakout area of the previous 1H Bear structure and appears as though it will break during today’s session.

Don’t see any viable short opportunities but for a long I will be looking to the newly drawn 15m structure and confluence at 62.25 with stop placed outside of the new structure and swing low at 61.25 targeting confluence at 63.75


I take all of these swing trades daily on my forward test. Feel free to follow along there and evaluate the results for yourself.

I’ve been reflecting on speculative bubbles that have marked our recent past, such as the dot-com bubble of 2001 and the 2008 financial crisis. Both had an enormous impact, but since then new regulations have been implemented and automation has revolutionized the way markets operate.

I wonder: is it less likely that similar events will happen again? What are the key factors to consider?

Regulation: After 2008, rules like the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States were introduced to increase transparency and limit systemic risk. Are these measures sufficient to prevent another crisis? Or is there always a way around them?

Automation and high-frequency trading (HFT): Automation has made markets more efficient but has also introduced new complexities. Algorithmic trading and HFT can amplify volatility and trigger chain reactions incredibly quickly. Does this make the market more stable or more vulnerable?

Psychological factors: Despite technology, market psychology remains crucial. Greed and fear can still drive investor behavior, creating bubbles and crashes. How can technology and regulation influence these human impulses?

In short, are we safer now, or is the next crisis just a matter of when and not if?

	•	buy a boat from a family friend for 7k (only really 2k out of pocket since I sold a project car for 5k)

Hope this post is allowed. I failed to mention this is a Vanguard personal advisor. With my retirement account, plus the $900,000 it's about 1.2 million that the personal advisor would manage. No special trusts.  All of the comments have been very helpful and kind. Thank you!

My husband and I are retired ages 67 and 71. I have my 401K, Sep IRA and Roth in personal advisor service for many years. Total account balance comes to $240,000. We recently sold a piece of commercial property and a cell tower easement and suddenly sitting on about $900,000.

We've had one call with a personal advisor assigned to us, tomorrow is the next call where they want a commitment to go with a specific personal advisor and present an investment plan.

To be honest I never call about the retirement accounts that are currently under personal advisor. In looking at the service of one specific personal advisor it's not like someone babysits your account and makes frequent changes, they look at the account every 90 days.

Is it really worth the $4000 plus a year in fees? I'm not really impressed with the current set up with my retirement account as the $IRA rollover and Sep IRA seem mostly bonds and the return is not great, yet I know they consider that diversified. The money is being made in the Roth where I have $58,000 that's about 95% stocks. I also understand that's the account with risk. When those accounts were set up The Roth and two IRA's were all I had for retirement, I realize that was the best allocation for that amount of money. Would the advisor be worth it just to make the best tax situations we would be in?

We have a large amount of capital gains to pay next year and I feel like I might be able to do this myself following my current allocations in my retirement accounts plus keeping cash safe for the capital gains.

They’re a niche player in medical technology, I’m curious what you think about their outlook.

What they do:

* Global market leader in proton therapy (used for advanced cancer treatment).
* Active in dosimetry (radiation QA), radio-pharma cyclotrons, and industrial accelerators (sterilization, polymers, even PFAS destruction tech).
* Installed base: 44 proton therapy sites, 700+ accelerators sold, 150k+ patients treated.

Moat / Strengths:

* \~60% market share in proton therapy equipment.
* Strong IP portfolio (500+ patents).
* Recurring revenue from long-term service contracts (€158m in FY24).
* Expanding into high-growth niches like theranostics (Actinium-225, Astatine-211) for targeted cancer therapies.
* One of the few B-Corp certified medtechs, ESG positioning.

Growth drivers:

* Proton therapy still in early adoption (0.5–1.5% of radiotherapy patients treated with it vs. \~20% potential).
* Big upside in China and the US, plus clinical trial momentum that could expand reimbursed indications.
* Industrial sterilization market shifting from Ethylene Oxide/Gamma → X-ray & e-beam (IBA’s strength).
* New ventures like PanTera (225Ac) and semiconductor applications.

Financials / Outlook:

* FY24 revenue: \~€498m, backlog €1.5bn.
* Service revenues and installed base scaling expected to improve margins.
* Management guides to \~10% REBIT margin by 2028 (currently low single digits).
* Capital-light growth in new ventures could add upside.

Risks:

* Competes with giants like Varian (Siemens Healthineers), Hitachi, Sumitomo, Mevion.
* High capex projects → revenues lumpy, margins volatile.
* High level of non-cash earnings
* Dependence on clinical trials and reimbursement for broader proton therapy adoption.
* Geopolitical & supply chain risks (tariffs, China exposure).

Would love to hear a broader community’s take on their stock, but my limited understanding is that they’re priced down due to the narrative that 5G competitors (T mobile, Verizon, AT&T) will eliminate the need for wired ISP providers and sharply impact Comcast’s future revenues. 

My flip side of this is that most people I know are using traditional ISPs and the product awareness isn’t there for the 5G providers, also Comcast has its own mobile telephone services and is expanding its streaming share with peacock etc. so I really think at a 5.5 PE and 3.82% dividend yield with additional cash put towards buybacks makes this an easy buy for me… but honestly I would love hearing others perspectives on this.

Wanted to add a bit more context to the decision making on this post, but at 5.5 PE with 3.82% dividend and 15B authorized buyback it seems like any narrative of failure driven pricing is off (imo).

I understand cable is a dying business, but honestly I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen a cable box, I think the damage to cable has been done, streaming services have reached an inflection point where they’re no longer discount providers and they look more like cable with 10 different subscriptions. The ISP moat is huge so my belief is that they have at least another 5yrs in business with Billions in FCF to figure out the best course of action.

The Fed is Not Cutting in September,1mumnf5,ToastTheCorgi,2025-08-19 16:03:10,933,0.92,407,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mumnf5/the_fed_is_not_cutting_in_september/,"Everyone piling into “September rate cut” bets is ignoring the actual data and listening to wishful thinking. The Fed isn’t going to hand out a cut just because markets want it.

The labor market is still holding up. Sure, unemployment has ticked up a little, but it’s nowhere near a collapse. Powell has already said they’ll tolerate some labor pain before even thinking about easing. If you’re waiting for the Fed to rescue every weak jobs print, you’re not paying attention.

Inflation is still too high. Core PCE is hovering above 2.5 percent and closer to 2.7 or 2.8. That’s not a victory lap. That’s exactly the range where Powell has said he doesn’t have “confidence” inflation is under control. Cutting now would risk reigniting it and blowing up the last two years of progress.

Powell is not a dove. Every time markets get ahead of themselves, he slaps them down. Jackson Hole is coming up, and if history tells us anything, he’ll remind everyone that the Fed is data dependent, not market dependent. Translation: he doesn’t care about your bets.

Credibility is everything right now. Cutting while inflation is still running hot and the jobs market is still functioning would make the Fed look weak. They’d rather be accused of holding too long than cutting too early and losing control.

History backs this up. The Fed doesn’t pivot on one or two soft jobs reports. Policy lags mean hikes are still filtering through. They know it. That’s why they’ll hold.

Bottom line: There’s no cut in September. Unless we suddenly get a jobs collapse and inflation magically melts away, the Fed is staying put. Markets want it, politicians want it, but Powell isn’t going to give it.",2025-08-19,-0.9175,Negative,['PCE']

Totally understandable that kind of stress can make anyone vulnerable. But it’s also led him into something that looks like a scam, and I’m not sure how to talk him out of it.

The company he’s gotten wrapped up in is called Solar Suns Investment Guild. He found it on Facebook (big red flag right there), and they’re promising crazy returns with almost no risk. From everything I can dig up, it’s clearly shady:

No regulatory registration that I can find (not listed with SEC/FINRA).

Press releases that look like pure self-promotion, not journalism.

Scam-alert websites already flagging them as a WhatsApp/Facebook “investment group scam.”

No independent reviews outside their own ecosystem, and the founder “Maverick Preston” has no verifiable background in finance.

I’ve tried explaining this to him, but here’s the issue, he already put money in. Now that he has skin in the game, he’s defensive and doubling down instead of questioning it. He thinks he’s “done the research” and is basically immune to hearing otherwise.

So, my problem isn’t identifying that it’s a scam, I’m pretty confident it is. My problem is: How do you convince someone who’s already invested in a scam that they’ve been taken? Especially someone who’s older, scared about retirement, and hanging on to the hope that this is their way out.

I don’t want to come across as condescending or make him dig in further. I just want to figure out how to show him clear evidence without him shutting down.

Here some lessons I've learned over the years and trying to implement so far... more or less well:

**Lesson 1: Position sizing**
- A 10% position going to zero hurts. A 50% position going to zero is catastrophic.
- Rule: Never put more than 1-10% in any single position, no matter how ""sure"" you are.

**Lesson 2: Correlation spikes during crises**
- Diversification fails exactly when you need it most
- ""Different"" sectors often move together during market stress
- That's why diversification in any possible dimension is important: sector, geography, market cap, growth vs value, time horizon, currency exposure, and even investment style, the more uncorrelated dimensions, the better your downside protection

**Lesson 3: Time horizon mismatch kills portfolios**
- Don't put money you need in 2 years into growth stocks
- Don't put retirement money in cash because of short-term market fears
- Match investment horizon to your actual needs, not market conditions

**Lesson 4: Liquidity matters more than expected**
- Small-cap stocks can drop 50% just from forced selling by funds
- Having 10-20% in highly liquid assets provides optionality
- Cash isn't always trash, it's a call option on opportunity

**Lesson 5: Know your breaking point**
- Everyone has a pain threshold where they'll panic sell
- Better to size positions for your actual risk tolerance, not theoretical optimum
- The best portfolio is the one you can stick with during tough times

Thoughts on an ex-US Strategy,1mua058,AverageApeAdventures,2025-08-19 05:45:18,19,0.75,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mua058/thoughts_on_an_exus_strategy/,"It is no surprise that American exceptionalism ebbs and flows with respect to the rest of the world. There is a cyclical nature to the dominance of the rate of change of US market capitalization, and as such there are clear periods where the US underperforms. 


The current geopolitical tensions coupled with a weakening USD may have started the cycle of the ex-US market outperforming the US for a while. Nothing about this is scary - it is a natural process that has been happening since the US was founded. Investors with a global vision have been wanting to take advantage of this situation and see which markets their capital would work the hardest for them.


As a long-term ETF advocate, dividend lover, and near Boglehead convert, I’d like to share with you some of my views regarding how I am planning on investing in a period of potential US underperformance. Let me start by saying that I am not divesting from the US, nor am I scared about my holdings of American companies. A large part of this is globalization and how a significant portion of American companies’ revenues come from abroad. On the other hand, you also have international companies, such as $ASML, that sell their goods and services to the US. Again, whatever the cycle may bring, and whenever it may start, or however long it may last, it is a natural process of global capital markets.


Without having you wait further, I will first list a couple of assumptions to guide this pseudo-analytical discussion:


1- The $ is weakening with respect to some important reserve currencies like € and will remain relatively weaker for a while


2- The US market overall has seen very high P/E ratios whereas ex-US companies have been relatively undervalued


3- Ex-US companies have higher dividend yields compared to their US counterparts


I hope that these points will significantly simplify and guide the following ideas. Let us look at the combined effects of these points and what conclusions they encourage us to draw:


1 & 2 - In $ terms, ex-US companies have gained value due to the $ devaluation which gives momentum to capital inflows into these companies (prices going up tend to draw more capital which makes prices go up further)


1 & 3 - Ex-US companies will be paying even more in dividends due to the devaluation of the $, meaning that even if they grow their dividends relatively little in their home currencies, in $ terms their dividends have already grown by about 10%


2 & 3 - As the undervaluation of the non-US market decreases, ex-US companies’ dividend yields will decrease which might push them to grow their dividends


Note that the pairwise interaction between these points is why we see an initial acceleration of the shift from US market capitalization towards ex-US market capitalization. There tends to be some overcorrective behavior which then results in a steady state, seen by the peak in the attached graph, followed by the reversal towards another cycle. Again, it is all natural. 


Now, the important question remains: what should investors do? More specifically, what have I been doing and will be continuing to do?


Well, I am well aware of the popular ETF VT, but suggesting that would be cheating as it makes this entire analysis redundant, and frankly would result in bland results. Of course the ETFs VXUS (all non-US markets) and VEA (developed non-US markets) are also very popular. VEA has the advantage of not dealing with emerging markets, which, while promising, act like a small- or mid-cap index. There is always some political unrest, missed loan payment, climatic challenges etc that make pureplay investments into emerging markets challenging. Yet, emerging markets tend to also grow the quickest - of course a feature of volatility. Therefore, it is generally accepted that you may as well lean towards VXUS, even though VEA slightly outperforms it. 


OK, but what do we do with the facts of $ devaluation and ex-US paying higher dividends compared to US companies? Well, we need to understand that the $ is devalued with respect to currencies such as the € or £, basically currencies of developed markets. We may be getting closer to an answer now… 


My favorite international dividend ETFs: 


* SCHY (a developed markets ETF with a dividend yield of 3.75% and an expense ratio of 0.08%) 


* VYMI (a total ex-US ETF with a dividend yield of 4% and an expense ratio of 0.17%). 


What I love about this pair is that they have a measly 16% overlap and hold a combined 1700+ companies! They present an incredibly diversified international dividend portfolio already.


If your favorite US-based ETFs are SCHD and VYM, this is probably great news for you. You are already familiar with this type of investment vehicle and might sleep better at night by adding them to your portfolio. 


For the younger folks out there, or those who simply want to have some more growth in an ex-US portfolio, the next perfect ETF will be… IDMO! If you are already familiar with SPMO, you will likely appreciate its ex-US counterpart as well. IDMO is the ex-US momentum ETF with a slightly steep expense ratio of 0.25% and a dividend yield of around 2%. 


IDMO is the perfect candidate to add to the base of SCHY and VYMI because it has very little overlap with both ETFs. Specifically, IDMO’s overlap with SCHY is around 11%, whereas it is slightly higher at 25% with VYMI. 


You may want to use these overlap values, dividend yields, as well as growth characteristics to create a portfolio of your own. Using a rudimentary portfolio backtesting tool starting from 2022, it looks like a portfolio made up of 40% IDMO, 30% SCHY, and 30% VYMI has a comparable performance to VOO whereas VEA lags severely behind (try it out yourself on https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults). The combinations of ETFs I suggest here has been able to hold its own against the S&P 500 during a period where the US has outperformed non-US capital markets.

My question is for anyone trading warrants. Is there typically a sweet spot for selling them? When purchased, the warrants had leverage of 4:1, and now, 3:1. Assuming that there is no extreme hype, eventually the benefit for warrant purchases will near 1:1, and there will be little benefit for purchasers but strong incentive to sell.

Does liquidity dry up? Will I find myself regretting not selling the warrants when they are around 2:1, since I will eventually have to sell cheaper to entice buyers anyways?

I’m interested in finding ways to invest in Ukraine, particularly with a long-term outlook on post-war reconstruction.

This was in the time period of 2011-2015 when I got my economics degree and first went into finance, before the first Trump victory was considered anything more than an extreme long shot / joke, before Brexit, before tensions with Russia and others rose to their current levels.

I recently watched [this very interesting lecture/discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWyFzmxV_oo) by Gillian Tett about the changes that the global order is now seeing. The US's isolationism and erratic, aggressive behavior is causing shockwaves in power relations and alliances. The geopolitical and global economic future is very uncertain now in a way it hasn't been for decades.

To me, this is as fundamental as fundamental analysis can possibly get. The behavior of the market is nothing more than the collective behavior of humans, and any sort of rational/calculated human behavior will collapse at the mercy of biological needs if our sources of food/water/shelter/safety are threatened. Risk in supply chains that feed/clothe us, and risk in political structures that (ostensibly) keep us safe from physical harm, should be reflected in the market. Option premium seems to be the most straightforward and easily observable variable that would show this.

And yet, VIX and option IVs are still behaving like it's 2014 and everything is hunky dory. How can this be? Or am I wrong and missing a way in which the market *is* reflecting this uncertainty? I would like to hear some well-informed thoughts about the relationship between these two things (geopolitical (in)stability and market (in)stability).

When ‘invest like the 1%’ fails: How Yieldstreet’s real estate bets left customers with massive losses,1mtjnl5,dvdmovie1,2025-08-18 11:43:07,336,0.95,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mtjnl5/when_invest_like_the_1_fails_how_yieldstreets/,"Yes, I know this is obvious to most but there's still enough questions about these sorts of services (and wanting to invest because they think diversifying away from stocks is good or they are attracted to the novelty of asset classes previously unavailable to them with ""invest like the 1%"" tag lines, etc) that I thought this article was a worthwhile reminder of the risks of these sorts of services.

Even if something you wouldn't invest in, fairly detailed and lengthy article that I thought was an interesting exploration of how (and how badly) some of these deals went wrong.

____________________________________

""When Justin Klish stumbled upon an ad for Yieldstreet in February 2022, he said, it was the company’s tagline that stuck in his head.

“Invest like the 1%,” the startup said.

The ad spoke to his desire to build wealth and diversify away from stocks, which were then in freefall, Klish said. Yieldstreet says it gives retail investors such as Klish access to the types of deals that were previously only the domain of Wall Street firms or the ultrarich.

So Klish, a 46-year-old financial services worker living in Miami, logged on to Yieldstreet’s platform, where a pair of offerings jumped out to him.

He invested $400,000 in two real estate projects: A luxury apartment building in downtown Nashville overseen by former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann’s family office, and a three-building renovation in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York. Each project had targeted annual returns of around 20%.

Three years later, Klish said he has little hope of ever seeing his money again. Yieldstreet declared the Nashville project a total loss in May, according to an investor letter, wiping out $300,000 of his funds. The Chelsea deal needs to raise fresh capital to avoid a similar fate, according to another letter. Both letters were reviewed by CNBC.""

And:

""In late 2022, Yieldstreet even told investors that real estate was a “safe(er) haven” asset during periods of rising rates and high inflation. By then, the Fed’s intent to squash inflation with higher rates was well understood.

“Real estate can be an effective inflation hedge, carries low correlation to traditional markets, and has even benefitted in times of market downturns, generating outsized returns,” the startup said in a blog post at the time.

In the post, Yieldstreet gave the example of the Alterra Apartments, a multifamily project in Tucson, Arizona, where it said rent increases and a contractual cap on interest rates protected it from the Fed hikes.

But this year, Yieldstreet told investors in the $23 million deal that the Tucson development was in technical default and headed for a full write-off.""

The problem is, checking all the time does not change the stock movements itself, but rather it changes us. When we see red, we panic, and green makes us greedy. The more we look, the more likely we are to act on emotion instead of logic.   
  
If for example, we only checked once a year, we would probably feel calmer and see more gains, as markets tend to go up in the long run.

Thinking of getting out of rental investment - taxes and what to do with proceeds,1mt70ot,stevejobs4525,2025-08-18 00:13:52,1,0.57,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mt70ot/thinking_of_getting_out_of_rental_investment/,"Long story short I have a bunch of rental properties, one of which was unintentional due to being my primary residence that I rented out when it didn’t immediately sell in the weak 2019 market (Florida).

Anyways the area has boomed and home prices for this type of property in particular are a lot higher now, unlike other parts of Florida this market continues to be hot and prices are growing.

Please can you help me game plan this, I have two questions really.

Question 1, Taxes:

I bought it in 2015 for $700k. I’ve spent about $80k on improvements since then, and I never claimed any depreciation on my taxes but I’ve heard differing information on whether that matters or not. I moved out in 2019 and it’s been rented since then. The most recent renters just moved out.

I think it would sell for about $1.6m in its current state and maybe $1.8m with about $100k of additional high roi improvements which I could do now it’s vacant.

I plan to move back in during said improvements but long term the home doesn’t meet my personal needs. But if taxes are going to be way different as a primary I could move back for 2 years. I’m a bit confused by the pro rating of the primary home sale taxes. Single filer. Really just looking for advice between the options I think I have if selling, and whether there are other options I’m missing.

1. sell after improvements and pay the capital gains
2. live there two years and then sell
3. sell after improvements and do a 1099 exchange on another property 

Proceeds 

In any option, selling it would yield a lot of cash even after taxes. I only owe $400k on it. I currently don’t need the cash and so would want to invest it. Would there be a lower risk option then dumping it all into index funds as a lump sum? The market seems high and ripe for a correction. It’s possible I’d want to access the funds to buy a new primary home but I’m not sure yet.

The most negative view of the markets would mean selling all assets I have in brokerage accounts, but there are also ""less extreme"" versions of this idea that would free cash to use in a downturn.

The dot-com bust was followed by the 2008 financial crisis, which significantly impacted the market's recovery, delaying when you would see your investment back at its peak value. According to Morningstar, if you invested in August 2000, the investment wouldn't have reached the same level it was at before the crisis until May 2013, making it a [12 year recovery period](https://www.morningstar.com/economy/what-weve-learned-150-years-stock-market-crashes). S&P 500 dot-com bubble and recovery

Quick note upfront: this isn’t about who’s right or wrong. Morality rarely gets priced in. I’m just looking at what actually matters for money flows, commodities, and positioning.


1. If Russia somehow gets reintegrated (low odds, but worth thinking about):
Europe wins big here with cheaper energy. German industry stops bleeding competitiveness. U.S. LNG exporters lose their pricing power in Europe, though U.S. corporates get access back to Russian markets. China loses some leverage over Moscow but gains a more stable supply situation. Net effect? Commodities cheaper, volatility down, Europe finally gets some breathing room.


2. The “frozen conflict” world (the one I think we’re in):
Nothing really ends, it just pauses. Think ceasefires, monitored corridors, shipping lanes with extra insurance. Middle powers (Turkey, Gulf states, India, Singapore) step in as brokers. That creates permanent friction costs: shipping, compliance, rerouting. Who wins? The mediators, commodity traders, LNG value chain, insurers. Who loses? Companies that depend on one clean global market.


3. Slow U.S.–China decoupling:
Already happening in tech and finance. Two ecosystems form: chips, telecom, AI standards. Supply chains get slower and chunkier, but volumes still move. China locks down Russian/Global South resources, U.S. doubles down on allies and tries to wall off advanced tech. Winners: “good enough” tech suppliers, regional hubs, commodity middlemen. Losers: multinationals stuck trying to straddle both blocs.



My takeaway as an investor: 

Markets are now built on managed volatility , insurance, compliance, shadow premiums. Middle powers are the real toll-keepers of global trade.

Moral resolutions don’t move capital. Frozen conflicts can last decades, but markets adapt around them.",2025-08-17,0.9385,Positive,"['LNG', 'LNG', 'AI']"

Upped my position to 12k shares prior to this latest release from the company: [https://ir.aspisotopes.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/75/asp-isotopes-inc-and-its-subsidiary-quantum-leap-energy](https://ir.aspisotopes.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/75/asp-isotopes-inc-and-its-subsidiary-quantum-leap-energy)



I don't see how the market didn't find this news favorable. Little shocked to see the stock sell off \~10% - but then again - it is basically a penny stock with only 3 analysts covering it. So large moves are pretty normal for these guys...

Signing a JV deal to start production of isotopes in the USA, in my opinion, is incredibly bullish. My only thought for the stock being down is maybe the latest news of Trump and Putin maybe getting along could actually be negative for the stock. This would be because Russia controls \~50% of the global uranium enrichment supply. And as we all know, Russia is blacklisted by the West right now, so no western allies can trade with Russia (at least for the most part) which is has added to the shortage of Uranium worldwide. There's a slight chance that Trump and Putin actually make peace and sanctions are lifted, but i HIGHLY doubt they lift sanctions on products/materials that are considered a national security risk (like Uranium/ HALEU/ Rare Earths/ etc.).

Anyways, I think this stock is just getting started. With a market cap under $1B this could EASILY 10x (i still personally believe 100x) if they can execute on enriching uranium to create HALEU. They would virtually be the only western commercial supplier of HALEU which is used to fuel most modern day nuclear reactors (SMR's). And I believe it is widely accepted nowadays that Nuclear power will be essential to generate enough power/electricity to power the AI revolution and data centers.

Worth taking a risk on this in my opinion. Thoughts?

Copied in my old post below where I got over my DD of the company from 7 months ago:

**TLDR:** If ASPI’s technology is truly what they say it is – this could be a 100x stock. Which wouldn’t be crazy given a $400M market cap currently (growing to $40B would be 100x). They could be one of the few Western providers of HALEU to fuel the West’s nuclear ambitions while deploying absurdly low capex. Not to mention potential revenue coming from the nuclear medicine and semiconductor fields (although I think the true homerun is with HALEU). However, if their technology isn’t as powerful as they say it is, this could be a true nothing-burger. Regardless, it is a bet I am willing to take. **Currently long 6,850 shares and looking to add more.**

**Bullish Points:**

• **Potential to Lower Isotope Costs**: ASP Isotopes has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of isotope enrichment through its proprietary Quantum Enrichment (QE) technology, which is more efficient and less expensive than traditional methods like centrifugation. The company's Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) is also comparable in efficiency to traditional centrifugation but at a much lower cost.

• **Countering Russian Dominance**: ASP Isotopes could help the West reduce its reliance on Russia for uranium supply, particularly for HALEU, which is crucial for next-generation reactors. This is especially important given geopolitical concerns and the US government's efforts to establish a domestic supply chain.

• **HALEU Fuel Production**: The company's technology is positioned to supply HALEU fuel for next-generation Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which are expected to drive nuclear industry growth. ASP's technology could be a low-cost platform to enhance HALEU production. Costs could be as low at $10M to cerate a QE plant to enrich uranium as compared to traditional centrifugation which costs in the $Billions. This alone is – if the technology is truly legit – could be massively impactful for the company and the whole industry. I believe the CEO, Paul Mann, wants to spin out QLE (the portion of the business that will work on enriching Uranium (HALEU) for nuclear energy. Need to keep an eye on this and how exactly that will/would affect the mechanics of owning shares in ASPI. But either way for now, the nuclear business is wrapped up with $ASPI.

o   Per the company’s website: “ASPI recently entered into a Term Sheet with TerraPower LLC which contemplates TerraPower providing funding for the construction of a HALEU Facility and TerraPower purchasing HALEU produced at the facility.” TerraPower is a Bill Gates backed Nuclear company. So I would assume at least Bill Gates thinks ASPI’s technology is worth taking a risk on partnering on. This happened on 11/14/24 btw, so old news.

• **Diverse Isotope Applications**: ASP Isotopes' enrichment technologies can produce a variety of isotopes for use in nuclear energy, nuclear medicine, and semiconductors, offering diverse revenue streams. The company already has supply contracts in place for isotopes such as molybdenum-100, carbon-14, and silicon-28.

• **Vertical Integration**: With the acquisition of PET Labs, ASP Isotopes has the potential to become a vertically integrated radioisotope supplier, creating feedstock isotopes for its medical arm. I’m not sure how big of an opportunity this could be but they do produce YT-176 which is the isotope used by Novartis’s Pluvicto (prostate cancer treatment). Well technically I think they convert the YT-176 to YT-177 for treatment, but you get the point. For this drug alone reached \~$1B in 2023. ASPI announced construction of a YT plant on 9/3/24 according to their website.

• **Attractive Takeover Target**: If the company demonstrates commercial production at scale, it could become an attractive acquisition target for larger companies. I don’t invest hoping for a takeover, but given the small market cap of this company, (\~$400M at last check), any big-name utility or hyperscaler could easily buy them out just for their tech.

• **Proprietary Technology**: ASP Isotopes possesses two novel, proprietary enrichment methods: the Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) and Quantum Enrichment (QE). I’m not an expert on their technology of course, but I believe it is proprietary to them. Would love to hear more on this as the whole thesis hangs on them being different and being able to construct plants at very low costs (especially for HALEU).

• **Strategic Locations**: The company is expanding into Iceland, which is attractive for its low energy costs, regulatory support, and proximity to a major shipping port. They will also add plants in South Africa.

• **Government Support**: The US government is actively working to establish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel, which is a positive sign for ASP Isotopes. It does worry me that they aren’t a US company, but building in SA and Iceland for now would be considered friendly and the US could do business with them. We know this given TerraPower has begun working with the company.

• **Established Operations**: ASP has already commissioned a small-scale plant and has commercial contracts. For now, revenue is still miniscule, but hopefully this will change soon.

**Bearish Points:**

• **Commercial Scale Risk**: While the company's technology has been proven in the lab (so they claim), the ability to scale up to commercial production has yet to be demonstrated. There is a risk that the company will not be able to reach commercial scale after successful lab trials.

• **Political Risk in South Africa**: The company's operations in South Africa may be subject to political risk, including the potential for unforeseen curtailments around the proliferation of enrichment technologies. This risk also includes concerns about the ability to export isotopes from South Africa.

o   I’m also worried about a Trump administration for ASPI. I’m not sure if this will be beneficial for them or not. Nuclear is bipartisan (one of the only areas that Congress agrees on), and while normally I would think friendly relations with Russia/Putin would be a good thing for the USA and the world, if relations get too friendly, it is possible Trump opens up trade again with Russia. This would definitely hurt ASPI’s growth potential.

• **Regulatory Approvals**: ASP Isotopes needs to obtain necessary government approvals and permits in South Africa for HALEU production, as well as in other countries like Iceland and for other end markets. I think they will be able to do this, but honestly idk how government regs and approvals work.

• **HALEU Demand Risk**: The demand for HALEU fuel is dependent on the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approving HALEU-based SMRs, which is not yet a certainty. $SMR has an approved SMR but doesn’t really have any legit customers yet (I’m also long $SMR and $OKLO). I do think the NRC will give approvals but I am unsure about the timeline. But if approvals do come, ASPI is in a great position to be a Western provider of HALEU.

• **Balance Sheet/Liquidity Concerns**: The company may need additional capital to execute its ambitious growth plans. In fact that is probably a certainty that dilution is on the board in the future. Maybe they can get more contracts with customers who will partner and help fund some of the costs of capex, but who knows. That would also come with some sort of downsides like being locked into only selling HALEU to that customer/partner for a certain amount of time (like the TerraPower deal).

• **Competition**: While the company claims its technology is superior to traditional methods and has lower costs, it faces competition from existing players in the nuclear fuel and isotope enrichment industry. Again, not an expert on this, but figured I’d note it again as it came to mind and is a huge risk. 

• **Shorts Taking Aim**: Some group called “Fuzzy Panda” put out a short report in late Nov 2024 that rocked the stock (fell from $8 to $4 in like 2 weeks). While I think this anonymous group called “Fuzzy Panda” made a bag shorting this stock, and they do bring up a couple legitimate concerns, I ultimately think the stock will shake this off. TerraPower (backed by Bill Gates) gives me some hope that the company is legit. Regardless, the stock is in the cross-hairs of the shorts right now which will add to the volatility of this already volatile stock.",2025-08-17,0.9993,Positive,"['ASPI', 'JV', 'USA', 'HALEU', 'HALEU', 'HALEU', 'SMR', 'AI', 'DD', 'TLDR', 'ASPI', 'HALEU', 'HALEU', 'ASP', 'QE', 'ASP', 'ASP', 'HALEU', 'US', 'HALEU', 'HALEU', 'ASP', 'HALEU', 'QE', 'CEO', 'QLE', 'HALEU', 'ASPI', 'ASPI', 'ASPI', 'LLC', 'HALEU', 'HALEU', 'ASPI', 'ASP', 'PET', 'ASP', 'YT', 'YT', 'YT', 'ASPI', 'YT', 'ASP', 'ASP', 'QE', 'HALEU', 'US', 'ASP', 'US', 'SA', 'US', 'ASP', 'ASPI', 'USA', 'ASPI', 'ASP', 'HALEU', 'HALEU', 'HALEU', 'US', 'NRC', 'HALEU', 'SMR', 'SMR', 'SMR', 'OKLO', 'NRC', 'ASPI', 'HALEU', 'HALEU']"

Since the market is near all-time highs, I don’t want to throw everything into ETFs right away. At the same time, I don’t want the cash just sitting idle waiting for a pullback.

I’m leaning toward high-dividend ETFs or dividend-paying stocks as a place to park the money for now. Definitely not interested in options (unless it’s the wheel strategy on solid value stocks).

Downsides?",1msd6b3,MeaslesofMankind,2025-08-17 00:50:15,0,0.42,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1msd6b3/ultrashort_fund_beating_corporates_treasuries_and/,"Just checked on my PULS. 30 day SEC yield is 4.53%. This beats corporates (A/BBB) by 30-60 bps. And beats higher qualities - Treasuries by roughly the same, and CD's by 30 bps.   
The TTM return is 5.03%.  

I figure the downsides are (for PULS, but somewhat similar for ultrashort funds in general)  
(1) the yield is not locked down, so possibly in Sept it will go down with the Fed cuts (depending on inflation numbers). But it's largely <1 year terms (50%) like the comparative assets' terms. And it has been well ahead of inflation. Duration is 0.29.  
(2) Treasuries and CD's are higher quality, but the fund has 50% AAA, and all investment grade. And short term.

Ultrashort funds seem like a good play for a good chunk of the portfolio (varying by your risk profile) - at the end of the business cycle, in a highly volatile environment, with inflationary fiscal policy and stats, and possibly headed for stagflation. Better than money markets in performance, stickier yield. Maybe a bit higher risk because of terms, but not sure about comparative quality if that matters with such short terms and investment grade.

Has anyone looked into it? They seem safe too. Am I missing anything?

With SPDA's, you pay in your ""principal"", and at the end of its n years term, you get it back with the interest as stated and compounded. It's not the lifetime annuity that I always stay away from because of risk and complexity in their terms. It's like a CD, except not FDIC insured (but insured in Maryland as required by Maryland law). Locked in rate like a CD, but a bit better rates, including Jumbo rates. It's compounded interest (are CDs?). It's provided by insurance companies rather than banks. And it has a bit higher rate than CD's. CD's have a secondary market; SPDA's do not. These also have early withdrawal penalties, but they do allow a no penalty 10% withdrawal each year.

Fidelity offers them only from 5-6 insurance companies that I believe pay to list them through Fidelity, but no direct fee to the client buying them. I suspect the advisor has some type of incentive too. But the insurance companies are all rated superior by [A.M.Best](http://A.M.Best), and S and P's (or is it moody's). I also checked with Fitch.

I sound like an ad for fidelity, but my question is: They seem safe? (and straightforward and easy, and a good rate)

  
Edit:  
Reiterating/Summarizing in response to some comments:  
\- This SPDA is fixed rate, fixed term, and at the end of the term I would get back the premium (principal) and accumulated interest. Interest is compounded. Very much like a CD but with a few key differences (see original post).  
   \-- after reading up on MYGAs, I think these would classify as such, although I think MYGA's also include lifetime terms; not sure if these offered include that.  
\- Not FDIC insured, but insured as required by law if in Maryland. The companies offering this have ratings from A.M. Best, Fitch, S and P's. Fidelity's limited offerings are all rated Excellent to Superior. Like banks that offer their own investment products, like CD's, it's as safe as the company; really, like corporations offering bonds.  
\- No fees or commissions paid by the client.   
\- Early surrender charges, like CD's, but no penalty withdrawals of up to10% per year.  
\- Consider these as one investment option in a portfolio balanced according to risk profile and investment objectives, and is classified as a fixed income asset type.  
\- There are some constraints related to tax deferred and 59 1/2, but I am already beyond that.

Thoughts on 8-10 year plan for a substantial down payment saving,1msam7g,JMPHeinz57,2025-08-16 22:57:39,3,0.64,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1msam7g/thoughts_on_810_year_plan_for_a_substantial_down/,"Hi all, 

Asking the typical question of where to plant money aimed at being a down payment for a house. For context, my wife and I are in our mid-20s with no debt, a fully funded six month emergency fund, and own both our vehicles living in the PNW of the US. We plan to buy a house in the next 8-10 years, but are deciding where to start saving towards a substantial down payment (aiming towards as much as possible).

I guess the gist of my question is, would it be wiser to place our monthly savings for the down payment in a HYSA for the estimated 8-10 years, or invest it in a single index fund such as FXIAX or FSKAX in that time frame? I know that historical returns show that the investing would likely bring substantially more money, but more volatility especially with this current administration. Also, would FXIAX or FSKAX be the better single investment of top 500 versus whole market?

Is there appetite for a crowdfunded investment in indoor tennis courts in Atlanta?,1mruwp8,PaintingMinute7248,2025-08-16 13:13:14,0,0.18,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mruwp8/is_there_appetite_for_a_crowdfunded_investment_in/,"Hey everyone,

I’m exploring a potential business venture and wanted to get some feedback from this community. The idea is to build a new indoor tennis facility in the Atlanta metro area, and I'm gauging interest for a potential crowdfunded investment model.

Here’s the basic premise and a breakdown of why I believe this is a high-potential investment:

**The Market: Atlanta is a massive tennis hub.**

* **Huge Player Base:** Atlanta is widely considered the ""tennis capital of the world"" for recreational play. The Atlanta Lawn Tennis Association (ALTA) and USTA Atlanta have a combined membership of over 100,000 active players. This isn't just a niche hobby; it's a deeply ingrained part of the local culture.
* **The Weather Problem:** For six to eight months out of the year, playing tennis outdoors in Atlanta is challenging at best. The summer months bring brutal heat and humidity (often with pop-up thunderstorms), and the spring/fall seasons are unpredictable with rain. This creates a huge, year-round demand for high-quality, climate-controlled indoor courts, which are currently in short supply. Players are constantly searching for indoor court time when the weather is bad.
* **High Demand, Low Supply:** Existing indoor facilities are limited and often part of expensive, exclusive clubs. There's a significant gap in the market for a facility that is accessible to the general public, league players, and those looking for lessons and clinics regardless of the weather.

**The Business Model: How it makes money.**

The revenue would come from a few key streams, ensuring profitability beyond simple court rentals:

1. **Court Rentals:** This is the base. Players and teams can book courts by the hour. Rates would be dynamic, with peak hours (evenings and weekends) commanding a premium.
2. **Memberships:** Offering monthly or annual memberships that provide discounted court rates, priority booking, and access to other amenities.
3. **Instruction & Programming:** This is the biggest money-maker for most successful clubs. We'd hire pros to offer private lessons, group clinics, youth academies, and summer camps. The demand for quality instruction in Atlanta is immense.
4. **Pro Shop & Ancillary Revenue:** A small pro shop selling gear, drinks, and snacks would add a solid revenue stream with high margins.

**Estimated Returns (Hypothetical)**

Based on initial research, a modern indoor facility with 4-6 courts, locker rooms, and a pro shop could cost anywhere from $3 million to $6 million to build, depending on the type of construction (e.g., fabric structures vs. traditional buildings).

Here's a simplified, hypothetical projection for a 5-court facility with a total cost of $4 million, assuming a successful crowdfunding campaign:

* **Total Project Cost:** $4,000,000
* **Crowdfunding Target:** $1,000,000
* **Venture Debt/Traditional Bank Loan:** $3,000,000
* **Annual Revenue (Year 3+):** Projected at $1.5M - $2M from a combination of court rentals, memberships, and programming. This aligns with what successful clubs can generate per court ($100k-$200k+ per court/year).
* **Annual Operating Expenses:** $900k - $1.2M (staff, utilities, maintenance, loan payments, etc.).
* **Projected Net Profit:** \~$400,000 - $800,000 per year.

For a crowdfunded investment, the structure could be a real estate-backed loan with a fixed interest rate, or an equity stake in the business.

* **Equity Model:** Investors would receive a percentage of the annual profits, and have an ownership stake in the business and its underlying real estate. With a 25% equity stake for crowdfunding investors, the annual return on a $1M investment could be $100,000 to $200,000, or a 10%-20% annual return. This is an oversimplified number, but it gives an idea of the potential.
* **Debt Model:** A fixed-rate loan model could offer a high, single-digit or low double-digit annual return (e.g., 8-12% interest paid out quarterly) until the loan is paid off or refinanced.

**The Question for You**

What are your thoughts on this? As investors, would you be interested in a crowdfunded opportunity like this? What would you look for in a business plan? Any advice on a platform for something like this (e.g., RealtyMogul, Fundrise, etc.)?

I'm an enthusiast, but this would be my first major business venture, so all feedback is welcome. Thanks for your time!",2025-08-16,0.9918,Positive,"['ALTA', 'USTA']"

I mean day trading with all the lines, candles and strategies it feels like everyone else is doing so much better.

I'm entering my second year of college and thought about using acorns to invest a little so I have some money for a rainy day. (I'm not financially literate at all)

Currently i have the max aid (I think) because my mom makes less than $20k and is a disabled vet.
I can only afford the college I'm at because I'm there entirely on scholarships and federal aid.

I read that the only non-reportable assets are retirement accounts (Roth IRA and 401K).
I can't invest under my mom's name because I believe it would mess up her eligibility for some federal aid.

I also read somewhere that students with a family income under 20k are specially exempt from having to report any assets (retirement or not) on the fafsa, but IDK if that's true. There was also something about extra scholarship money (which I thankfully have this year) becoming taxable income. Is that something I would need to report on my taxes/fafsa next year? I'm not sure if it has limitations or if i have to give back what i don't use yet.

I don't really understand how most of this works, hence the wanting to use an investment app.

I have a family of 4 currently. My wife and I started investing about 5 years ago at around age 24-25. We dumped most of our savings with a local investor manager who helps young families start the ground running. He charges extremely small fees (next to none) and take select families who are poor. We started with around 30-40k and it has grown to about 90k - with an extra 6-10K added in during different years. We ended up doing more lump sums than monthly investments (a regret as a look back at it). I have another 20k in a high savings account I never put in as we thought we were moving provinces/states, which never happened. Our third account is an RESP for our children that has about 26k in it from the last 4 years of investing and government matching. We have about 5k in bank left right now that we have to use for recent bills (we had to just go through about 6k in major expenses that had to do with health). 

  
Unfortunately, we have had multiple deaths in our family which caused years of depression and brain fog (loss of motivation or any sort of drive and desire). I have just recently overcome this hump and am feeling much better mental health wise. I am looking to learn to better invest and create a better future for my family. I am just realizing how much better we would be off if we had invested monthly. We were spending too much on unnecessary things and not really running with a budget. This has now changed.

How well are we doing sitting at around the $110k at the age of 30? What % should I be investing every month? With our incomes combined and child benefit payments we are sitting at around $5,700 per month income.

Edit: We have 0 debt. We lived with family to make sure we were debt free. Our rent is around 2k a month. Regular expensive grocery bills. And we invest about $460 per month in kids RESP. We are thinking of doing $1100 in our TFSA per month. The 5700 is take home after taxes and deductions. ",2025-08-15,0.9254,Positive,"['RESP', 'RESP', 'TFSA']"

At first, it was mostly retirement savings and it was always in the back of my mind where her retirement portfolio is at vs mine.  We are both 7 figures without ever using megabackdoor in mid 40's.  Of course, we do our own thing there and there's no impact.

Then around 10 years ago, we started to open taxable accounts.  At first we were taking advantage of deposit bonus and thus we never open an account with joint names.  In fact, we would refer each other and play the free money game both ways, double deposit bonus with a refer a friend bonus.   I think we got 7K combined from her opening a Schwab account and then referred me and I opened a Schwab account for that same bonus The byproduct is we have many brokerage accounts (2 sets of Schwab, Merrill, Fidelity, Etrade) under single names and naturally I become custodian of one half and she the other half.  This is CA where it is community property so it makes no difference whether there are multiple name on it.  And we kinda do our own thing here and inadvertently compete.

Our investment philosophy is pretty much the same except she leans Netflix, Spotify, Shoplfy and things of that nature more and I lean more AI and AI infrastructure more and I primary play covered call options.  Of course there are many stocks overlap and we often don't coordinate in a way that does always makes sense and it could be we have opposite positions.  We both buy CA muni when the after tax yield hits 5.5% (we are in 54% tax bracket so CA muni makes sense for us) as long as it's  not LA or Oakland bonds.  We Both don't have any single security over 5%, etc.

It's kinda working because my spouse is brilliant and vice versa, but it is kinda weird when I say sell say coinbase and she buys the same thing in parallel.

I am believer in BTC both as a source of uncorrelated alpha and a hedge to a non-fiat monetary regime.

And like many of you, I foolishly thought MSTR was a levered bitcoin play in a convenient package led by this visionary named Michael Saylor.

Then I actually did some DD.

1. He has been convicted of two financial crimes (SEC fraud in 2002 and IRS fraud in 2024). People don’t change unless something traumatic has happened to them.  As far as I can tell, Saylor is still rich since 2002.

2. MSTR is using basic financing mechanisms to issue debt to buy more BTC, in the hopes that investors will drive up his stock price so he can buy more.  It is trading at a 100% premium to its BTC holdings with no real IP.

3. Saylor’s behavior on Twitter is troubling.  Many of his posts are AI-generated images of him in some ego fantastical pose.  If you actually read the underlying message and manipulation being used here, it’s obvious he’s trying to trick retail investors into buying more MSTR.

There are much cleaner ways to get levered BTC exposure without any of the company and single-man risk of MSTR.

$10,000 is your investment.

÷ $0.64/share

= 15,625 shares

× 2.5 (warrants)

= 39,063 (39,062.5) total (company name), shares


The math on your price per share 

is $0.64 ÷ 2.5 shares = $0.256/share.


For every share you buy you receive 1.5 

warrants equalling 2.5 shares total. 


Warrants are equal in value to the shares.

They increase your number of shares by 

a factor of 2.5 times.


Selling (company name) shares@ $100/share 

could give you a profit of $3,906,300 (3,906,250).

Just wanting to vent and also celebrate diligence/luck. 

My parents have been meteorically bad with finances. Mom - worked a high salary fortune 100 job for 25 years then transitioned to operating her own business. Father - stay at home dad, did projects on the property to create rentals for additional income. In 2019, their finances were ugly. Credit card debt (100k+), little to no savings due to medical bills and poor spending habits. I helped them get their financials in order. Consolidate debt. Pay it down. Fast forward, Covid hit -- found out last week they took over 400k loans and put our family home up as collateral. They have since spent all the money. Including the mortgage they're over 1m in debt. 

Even the money I gave them to pay my students loans off was used elsewhere (30k+). They're older (60, 70+) in life and have a 10k+ monthly burn rate and are on a razers edge if anything happens (medical incident, losss of rent) to lose everything. It so sad. So frustrating. They told no one and now they're in such a bad hole. We had planned on keeping the home but this is now unlikely. 

On the flip side, I've been investing since 21. Paying off all debt. Max contributions to 401k, Bitcoin, index funds, individual stocks, starter home which I'm turning into a rental. I've tried to be as diligent as possible and now have crossed 750k networth mark at 31. A lot of diligence, fortunate timing, luck and remaining risk averse. 

Now I get to figure out how to help them again without setting myself on fire to keep them warm. 

Tldr: learned what not to do from my parents financial mishaps. ",2025-08-15,-0.8335,Negative,[]

I’m planning to redistribute my savings and would love some feedback. Here’s my current allocation plan:

* **Cash reserve**: From 44% to 7%
* **Maximum risk**: Keep at 12%
* **Medium risk**: From 17% to 39%
* **Minimum risk**: From 28% to 43%

A bit about the categories:

* **Cash reserve**: Day-to-day expenses + 12-month emergency fund (might be overkill).
* **Maximum risk**: Bitcoin, high volatility but potentially huge upside.
* **Medium risk**: ETFs, P&G, and other blue-chip stocks.
* **Minimum risk**: CDs with \~5% annual interest, low risk and stable.

**Goals**:

* Keep enough liquidity for emergencies.
* Maintain upside exposure with Bitcoin.
* Generate steady returns via medium-risk investments.
* Preserve capital with low-risk instruments.

**Questions for the community:**

* Does this allocation seem reasonable for someone with low-to-medium risk tolerance?
* Would you increase the cash reserve or shift more to minimum-risk instruments?
* Any ideas on tweaking the medium-risk portion for better growth without adding too much risk?

Are multi-vertical tech ecosystems (AI + Gaming + Fintech infra) the next big investment wave? A case study discussion.,1mq0gb9,ionutvi,2025-08-14 13:18:51,0,0.33,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mq0gb9/are_multivertical_tech_ecosystems_ai_gaming/,"Over the past few years, we’ve seen how companies that control *multiple, interconnected verticals* can create stronger economic moats than single-focus startups. Think of Tencent (games + payments + social), Amazon (retail + cloud + streaming), or even Apple (hardware + services + payments).

I’ve been following a new wave of companies building similar “ecosystems” in emerging industries particularly at the intersection of:

* **AI SaaS tools** (content generation, agents, automation)
* **Gaming/metaverse platforms** (immersive worlds with real economies)
* **Fintech-grade transaction infrastructure** (instant, low-cost settlement across platforms)
* **Owned social networks** for direct user retention & acquisition

The investment thesis is that each vertical strengthens the others:

* AI tools drive developer adoption in the gaming/metaverse space.
* Social platforms reduce customer acquisition costs.
* Payments infrastructure monetizes user activity without relying solely on ads or in-game purchases.

From an investor’s perspective, I’m curious how others are valuing companies that:

1. Already have multiple working products in different verticals.
2. Monetize not just the end-user product (like a game) but also the underlying infrastructure (like a DEX, payment rails, or AI platform).
3. Operate globally from day one.

In my view, the right execution here could create network effects similar to those that made Tencent and SEA Group attractive to investors years ago. But the risk profile is higher because you’re betting on multiple product categories at once.

**Questions for the community:**

* Do you see this “multi-vertical integration” as a moat or as a distraction for early-stage tech companies?
* How do you think such companies should be valued on a sum-of-the-parts basis, or on potential ecosystem synergies?
* Have you invested in, or tracked, any companies operating in this combined AI + Gaming + Fintech space?

Instead of the usual screens (dividend aristocrats, high yield, etc.), we built a 100-point framework weighing four factors:   

**The Framework:**

* Yield Quality (25 pts) - Not just the percentage, but sector-relative positioning and sustainability ranges 
* Growth Potential (25 pts) - Historical dividend CAGR + forward analyst estimates through 2029 - 
* Sustainability (30 pts) - Payout ratios, FCF coverage, balance sheet health, forward earnings outlook
* Consistency (20 pts) - Track record + sector-relative performance during downturns

**August Results (based on SP500 stocks):**

1. UnitedHealth (9.0/10) - 3.4% yield, 17.7% dividend growth
2. QUALCOMM (8.0/10) - 2.3% yield, 7.1% dividend growth
3. Accenture (8.0/10) - 2.5% yield, 10.2% dividend growth
4. Snap-on (8.0/10) - 2.6% yield, 15.0% dividend growth
5. VICI Properties (8.0/10) - 5.3% yield, 15.2% dividend growth

**Key Insights:**

* Healthcare, tech, and specialized industrials dominated
* Only one REIT (VICI) made the cut - most traditional REITs scored poorly
* Forward-looking analysis (analyst estimates, sector health) proved crucial

The most surprising finding**:** Accenture, a consulting company most don't realize pays dividends, and Snap-on, a tool manufacturer, scored higher than virtually every ""dividend aristocrat.""

Beyond that, do you keep additional money?

From a research perspective, it’s sub-optimal from what I hear to keep extra cash. By choosing when to deploy vs keep in reserve additional cash you are actively investing instead of passively investing (passive inferring just continuously buying ETFs). The majority of active traders lose out to the general market (bankrate.com - James Royal PhD). So you, as a non-expert will most certainly miss-time or poorly execute on average when to “invest” those funds.

Secondly it makes no sense from a potential gains perspective. Utilizing the theory of the time value of money, we know that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. 

The common argument on the contrary I see is that if you go back to the April lows of this year, buying during that time allowed you to buy at prices from over a year prior. If you had been holding cash up to that point you would have made solid interest, avoided downside, and been able to buy at year’s prior prices.

For the past year, I've been borrowing Ethereum at 2%, and re-lending it to someone shorting Ethereum with a different collateral mix so they needed to pay 4%. I could lend Ethereum at 3% to them to pull down their rate. Now, on occasion the differential would spike crazy high so I have a 15% gain in the amount of Ethereum versus my initial position.

I'm pretty sure the same thing could be done with stocks. Basically, all a brokerage is is a DeFi lending protocol with their own rate structure. So, if I wanted to open a short position in Newegg stock on Fidelity, not sell it, but take those shares transfer them to IBKR to collect their higher interest rate how would I do it? I do not believe I can just borrow the shares.

I have used a USD defi loan to arbitrage the rates in savings accounts, until the rates diverged. Essentially, I think defi tells us what the Fed should set the cost of capital to. If the Fed is too high defi lowers rates through liquidation nearly immediately, and if it's too low they raise rates. Maybe, their charter should be repealed.

Next Top - 20% > Current Price

Next Top > 8060

8060 is 6450 + 25% !

This means we will fall back to 6450 or lower again unless the next top is above 8060 - unless SP500 rallies continuously for ANOTHER 25% in the next couple years.

Cracker Barrel is a gem of a company disguised as a dying brand. First let's look at is CBRL's strong financials...

Besides ONE key financial which I will address later.

# Financials

Cracker Barrel offers a strong 1.7% dividend yield, with indications that it could be raised to even higher. They have a modest P/E of 23, with a projected forward P/E of 18. Institutions also love CBRL with an % held by institutions of 105%. And insiders seem to have some mixed feelings, with a net even buy/sell from insiders with a total % held by insiders of 2%.

Now, the BAD financial. They have 1.4 billion dollars of debt. With 10 million dollars of cash. This is why there is 5M shares short with a short ratio of 6. Now this is a lot, but I'll explain why this can be partly overlooked later.

# Properties

This is the first BIG reason I believe CBRL's true value is much higher than 1.3B. Cracker Barrel does NOT franchise meaning they either own or lease all of their properties. They own 358 of their properties and lease 368 according to the latest 10K. At about 4M per property and 358 properties, 4M \* 358 = 1.432B of just property value. This alone is enough to cover the debt and have 368 properties and 200M left over. This also does not take into account corporate properties.

page 32 for property info

# Growth

Second BIG reason why CBRL is undervalued. Strong projected growth AND active management. And the latter is really what I want to touch on. Cracker Barrel Corporate has been fighting to keep the company relevant. They have been testing out rebrands and expanding to other states outside of the south.

# Conclusion

Cracker Barrel is a company that is severely undervalued and is a buy. Just like DeepFuckingValue preaches, find fundamentally undervalued companies and invest. And that's what CRBL is.

TL;DR: Cracker Barrel is extremely undervalued and has a lot of room for growth

How to best handle a large windfall.,1molrhi,Responsible_Art_6553,2025-08-12 21:35:01,0,0.14,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1molrhi/how_to_best_handle_a_large_windfall/,"Long story short I was given about $1.2M in stocks a few months ago.  This was from my parents who created and transferred a Trust to me.  The stocks were originally all invested in one particular stock.  According to my ML app I am already sitting on pretty much a 100% unrealized gain that hasn’t been taxed.   I’m guessing I am eating the capital gains that this stock earned between when my dad got it and he transferred it to me.   

My FA from Merrill (that has handled my father’s significantly larger accounts for decades) already had me sell $100k and diversify it.  I didn’t ask too many questions but I’m sure this isn’t necessarily a bad idea.   He said he wanted to work on diversifying it all out over a couple years when the market dictates it making sense to do so.  I don’t know enough to argue. 

I get around $9k in dividends every quarter.   My idea with that is to pull half or so to supplement my income while keeping/reinvesting the rest.   I know there are going to be tax issues to deal with so I want to make sure I have some money around to handle whatever may happen.  

So I make decent money, pay all my own bills, don’t really need much of anything.  Like I said, I’m using dividends to supplement a bit but that’s just because my bills seem to always go up faster than my income.   I also am fully aware that at some point down the road I likely have a significantly larger amount of money headed my way. But I don’t want to depend on that and want to make smart decisions.   

I’m in my mid forties and would love to retire around 50 when my kids are all adults and out of the house.  Their schooling is already paid for so I don’t have to worry about out that.  I just don’t want to work until I’m too old to enjoy retirement like my father did.  By the time he retired he was too old to enjoy anything other than an easy chair and bad television.   

Any advice on how I can best use this money to secure early retirement.   Since I live cheap, house almost paid off, I don’t think I need a crazy account to comfortably retire by 50.  I think 2.5-3 would be more than enough to live off dividends alone in retirement.   What is the best way to really make sure this money becomes all it can be.   Safely, at least kinda safely.  


Really just looking for any insight or advice on how to handle these accounts.   Should I trust my FA?   Anything in particular I should look into pursuing?   TIA

I’m 15 and based in Dubai. I currently have AED 1,100 (~$300) to invest, plus I can add AED 50/month going forward.

Here’s my idea so far:
	•	Long-term core: AED 900 into index funds/ETFs (maybe split between Nifty 50, S&P 500, and silver).
	•	Short-term “opportunity” money: AED 200 reserved for quick trades when there’s a likely catalyst (e.g., buying Apple shares before a new iPhone launch). This AED 200 would be reused for each short-term opportunity.

Goals:
	•	Build long-term wealth while still learning about markets.
	•	Use the short-term pot to gain experience with event-driven trades.

Questions for the community:
	1.	Is my split (900 long-term / 200 short-term) reasonable for my age?
	2.	Any better way to diversify my long-term AED 900?
	3.	Is it worth doing short-term “event” trades with such a small amount, or should I just go all-in on long-term index investing?
	4.	Any UAE-friendly ETFs or brokers you’d recommend?

Thanks in advance!

Need Advice: Managing $450k Trust for My Mother’s Long-Term Care,1moaxk5,Beerddviking626,2025-08-12 14:54:34,11,0.86,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1moaxk5/need_advice_managing_450k_trust_for_my_mothers/,"Hi everyone,

I (M, 31) recently became the sole trustee of a trust for my mother (F, 60). The trust is currently worth about $450,000. I have some investing experience, but nothing on this scale or for this phase of life and I want to make sure I manage it responsibly for her long-term benefit.

Background: 
- My mother is in decent health, though she has some chronic conditions (currently managed and covered by Medicare).
- She doesn’t need , nor does the trust require minimum distributions.
- She lives in a fully paid-off tiny house on my property. It’s safe, secure, and close to family. I cover about $350/month in upkeep, which is manageable for me.
- She is happy with the life she has. 
- In 10 years, if the trust is at a good place for future care, I’d like to use moderate and responsible distributions to enhance her quality of life, for her to travel or do whatever else she wants in her golden years.
- I did not choose to be the trustee, I accepted my mother’s request, but this type of management is a little beyond me so I am getting as much advice as I can.  Both on Reddit and multiple advisors in the real world. 

Goal:
- I believe that I need to grow the trust from $450k to $1.1–1.2M+ to reasonably have a chance to cover the costs  for long-term care or nursing home costs without depleting it entirely. Ideally, I’d like for this to be completed by her early 70’s. 

Additionally, My career is still getting established, but I hope that in over the next 10 years to be able to cover larger costs myself without tapping into the trust prematurely. 

Current steps I have taken: 
- Secured a CPA and assessed 2025 tax liability (there is next-to-none this year) 
- Set up 2 brokerage accounts under the trust, (one for fixed income, one for long-term growth) 2 linked checking accounts.
- in the process of finding a financial wealth advisor I can trust within my brokerage for long-term counsel. 

Initial Plan: 
- Plan to invest ~$135,000 in short-term (0–3 month, SGOV) U.S. government bonds for liquidity while we handle some small necessary purchases during this transition.

The Big Question: 
That leaves about $315,000 to invest. 
My preliminary idea:
- 85–90% in short-term bonds for stability and monthly maturity to pay for initial legal costs this year while not touching principle.
- 10–15% initially in either a broad market index fund or the S&P 500 ETF VOO. 
- Dollar-cost-average the equity portion from short term bonds to equities over the next 12 - 18 month until the trust is about 60/40 - 70/30 split between equities/bonds. 

I’m conflicted for these considerations: 
- On one hand, the U.S. stock market seems increasingly disconnected from the reality of the country’s economic and fiscal policies. The S&P 500 appears determined to keep grinding upward, regardless of current events.
- On the other hand, with the S&P 500 at all-time highs again, the market doesn’t seem eager to break far beyond those levels until there’s a clear, sustained direction in international trade or economic policy.

This is all before even considering the somewhat unusual, and sometimes erratic  policy declarations by the executive branch. Not addressing growing tensions between the executive branch and the Federal Reserve, the new appointment of the Chair and how that might influence fiscal policy.

All of that being said, I know that am a layman in all of these matters and don’t pretend to know anything for real. So Any advice on these matters would be great. 

1. Asset allocation for a trust with this specific goal.

2. Is this realistic timeline or a wise goal for the trust? 

 3. Any considerations for general trust management that I might be overlooking.


Thanks for any advice!

If you back test from 1972 to today, a portfolio of 100% small cap value with monthly cashflows massively outperforms large cap growth or blend. This seems to be true for global markets.

People are constantly focusing of ETFs like QQQM, SPMO, SCHG, etc. due to recency bias, in my opinion. Why? It seems like even in the ETF/mutual fund space, if you just focus on valuations and staying the course, you will come out very successful. 

Why is the S&P 500 still considered a good general investment for most people 5+ years before retirement when if you did 50/50 VIOV/VOO from early on, you'd probably perform way better just because you're buying out of favor companies?

- capabilities (money movement - Fidelity is terrible, but Schwab is fine; auto-tax loss harvesting; easy to directly own stocks covering S&P vs invest in index fund, etc.)

Looking at next year honestly feels similar. We're getting Avatar 3, Toy Story 5, Zootopia and new Starwars.

maybe you dont like the milking out of the same franchises but it prints. 

those cultural moments will spill over in the parks, cruises, subs, merch... The marketing team will make sure of that. 

Parks are record breaking, cruises are fully booked and streaming is finally profitable since Q3 2025 (yeah it took them this long lol). If a couple of films create the same buzz as in previous years, we will see the jump in the stock prize. 

plus p/e is looking good atm,way below historical average. 

when comparing, I def see the market wakes up quick once the first hit lands. 

I know it's not a growth company doing AI-overlord stuff and they def sturred the woke-soap for too long. Yet I think it's a good company which ol' warren would like.

But, to be able to perform proper portfolio management, we need to protect the whole thing, not every single position.

"Coinbase Sellers, Did You Miss This Good News?",1mmsa38,StockBrokenUSA,2025-08-10 19:53:06,0,0.46,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mmsa38/coinbase_sellers_did_you_miss_this_good_news/,"Coinbase recently set out to raise $2.6 Billion in capital by issuing private debt.

The market quickly reacted to this with a recent dose of their earnings report and plunged the $COIN stock unfavorably to the low-300s.

I, however, see their recent earnings and capital raising efforts as an incredible win and the details that have come from their recent convertible debt issue confirms where big institutions see the price of Coinbase going in the near future.

I'm going to skip over the talk on the earnings and how Coinbase will diversify their revenue streams in the coming years and acquire businesses with good synergies. That's all a given.

Focusing only at their debt raise, here's what we know:

**Issue 1**: 1.3 Billion (Now, 1.5 Billion) due to mature 2029 @ 0% interest. Convertible to 2.2 shares per $1000 par.

**Issue 2**: Another 1.5 Billion due to mature 2032 @ 0% interest. Also convertible to 2.53 shares per $1000 par

The implied conversion price/Breakeven for

**Issue 1 : $454**

**Issue 2: $394**

We also need to know Coinbase's rating on senior debt : **BB -**

This means that new senior debt comes with a **required rate of return** of **5.68-5.8% as of 8/08/2025**.

For either of the private firms that acquire those debt issues to be compensated at the rate of the next best alternative ( **the 5.68-5.8%), the price would need to increase by minimally 54%** in the first year for the **2029 issue.** And the stock would need to go up by **34% for the 2032 issue.**

The current price of Coinbase as of **8/8/2025 being $310.50** means that these private investors have strong expectation of the stock price to increase in order for them to make their baseline required rate of return.

**Other Concerns:**

I saw a lot of news pointing to the dilutive effects of the convertible bonds adding to the total stock outstanding. And although this may carve away from existing owners, the dilutive effects, in total, would only dilute your ownership down by **<3%; \~2.7% more precisely.**

The other side of that news is that part of the proceeds from this debt raise by Coinbase will be used to purchase **Capped-Calls** to prevent dilution from the converted bonds. The cost of hedging the entire amount of shares that would be dumped into the market is less than **$1MM/yr,** given the current pricing of call options at the **conversion price and cap price**.

I don't want to go too far into detail on how capped calls work because the important thing to address is the fact that dilution is not a huge factor here and to hedge the firm from any amount of dilution due to these convertible bonds would be less than pennies on the dollar.

TLDR:

The private investment in Coinbase's new debt issue has revealed what really big players and smart money think of the direction of the stock price in the short run. **Best estimates** would insist that the stock price should minimally be around **$495-560 within the next 4 years.** This has an implied **CAGR of 12-16%** in conservative cases.

This valuation is due to the required return for private issuers to be compensated for senior debt, given coinbase's current credit rating of **BB-.**


EDIT: Made a gross oversight by stating private investors would expect to profit from the appreciation of stock thereby giving them opportunity to convert out of the convertible notes. 

One measure they can take before the stock price even goes up is that they can short the stock now and make significant returns in light of the stock moving down. 
That said, since the time of the debt issue announcement, short interest in COIN has decreased.

After quiting the stock market during covid crash, I want to rebuild a portfolio by constantly investing until I reach a 60% equity ratio of total wealth within 2-3 years. I invest monthly since beginning of 2025. I am 52 and plan to retire at 70ish. I live in Europe.

I am undecided and fear an imminent market crash, as stock markets had an incredible ride the last 5 years and politics are crazy atm.

My open question is, if I should go for a) a low fee ETF basket or b) actively managed fonds, as they have a much lower volatility?

For example:
a) 75% MSCI world etf + 15% euro stoxx 50 etf + 5% gold + 5% crypto or 

b) actively managed multi asset fonds. black rock multi asset fonds and flossbach von storck multi asset growth fonds.

The only way to sustain this is by reducing the leverage of the portfolio to just a 1,15 rate. Why do people still recommend the way higher rates which would cause margin calls?

14% unallocated (sold FSKAX in Roth)

8% VOO

4% SPAXX 

1% QQQM

1% FBTC

1% FTEC

My plan so far:

- Allocate 10% from Roth to IDMO and remaining % to SPMO. Allocate SPAXX funds to SPMO. This puts me at 10% international and 8% SPMO. Both with momentum trading. Expense ratios are 0.13% and 0.25% respectively. Not great, not bad but I’m willing to give it a try.

- Continue building QQQM and FBTC positions. FBTC up to 5% probably. 

- Stop buying VOO since I would just create more overlap.

- Maybe get to a higher international allocation. Still debating this.

1. Dec 2024: paid off student loans and credit card debts
2. Jan 2025: paid off the mortgage
3. Jan 2026: I plan to buy a new car and pay it off in full

Why stretch it out over 3 years:

1. For tax planning purposes, stretching over 3yrs lessens the impact of capital gains taxes due
2. Simultaneously this allows plenty of time for my personal stock portfolio to grow and recover
3. Also investing more via dollar cost averaging allowed me to purchase more shares during market down fluctuations
4. Lastly, capital gains taxes are due by April 15 of the following year giving me some wiggle room to save enough money to pay off my capital gains taxes in full using Savings
5. Bonus: because I have no debts, reinvesting all the freed-up money allows my stock portfolio returns to compound faster, daily, monthly and annually

\_\_\_\_\_

To estimate the future value of a $650,000 investment in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), we can use historical performance data and reasonable assumptions about future returns. Below, I’ll provide projections based on historical compound annual growth rates (CAGR) and address the inherent uncertainties. All calculations assume dividends are reinvested (DRIP) and no additional contributions are made. I’ll use conservative, moderate, and optimistic scenarios to reflect potential market variability.



\### Key Assumptions

\- \*\*Historical Performance\*\*: According to available data, VTI has delivered a total return CAGR of approximately 10% over the past 30 years, with a 10-year CAGR of around 13.03% (with DRIP).\[\](https://investguiding.com/articles/how-much-will-vti-be-worth-in-10-years)\[\](https://www.dripcalc.com/stocks/vti/)

\- \*\*Scenarios\*\*:

  \- \*\*Conservative\*\*: 8% CAGR, reflecting potential economic slowdowns or lower market returns.

  \- \*\*Moderate\*\*: 10% CAGR, aligning with long-term historical averages.

  \- \*\*Optimistic\*\*: 12% CAGR, closer to recent 10-year performance but below peak years.

\- \*\*Formula\*\*: Future Value = Present Value × (1 + CAGR)\^Time

\- \*\*Current VTI Price\*\*: Approximately $311.07 as of August 2025.\[\](https://coinpriceforecast.com/vti-stock)

\- \*\*No Adjustments for Inflation\*\*: Values are nominal (not adjusted for inflation).

\- \*\*Risks\*\*: Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Market volatility, economic downturns, or geopolitical events could impact returns.



\### Calculations

Starting investment: $650,000



\#### 5 Years (2030)

\- \*\*Conservative (8%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.08)\^5 ≈ $954,670

\- \*\*Moderate (10%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.10)\^5 ≈ $1,046,566

\- \*\*Optimistic (12%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.12)\^5 ≈ $1,145,361



\#### 10 Years (2035)

\- \*\*Conservative (8%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.08)\^10 ≈ $1,403,383

\- \*\*Moderate (10%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.10)\^10 ≈ $1,685,790

\- \*\*Optimistic (12%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.12)\^10 ≈ $2,016,640



\#### 20 Years (2045)

\- \*\*Conservative (8%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.08)\^20 ≈ $3,026,876

\- \*\*Moderate (10%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.10)\^20 ≈ $4,368,375

\- \*\*Optimistic (12%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.12)\^20 ≈ $6,270,856



\#### 30 Years (2055)

\- \*\*Conservative (8%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.08)\^30 ≈ $6,529,115

\- \*\*Moderate (10%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.10)\^30 ≈ $11,321,594

\- \*\*Optimistic (12%)\*\*: $650,000 × (1.12)\^30 ≈ $19,483,923



\### Summary Table

| Time Horizon | Conservative (8%) | Moderate (10%) | Optimistic (12%) |

|--------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|

| 5 Years (2030)  | $954,670          | $1,046,566     | $1,145,361       |

| 10 Years (2035) | $1,403,383        | $1,685,790     | $2,016,640       |

| 20 Years (2045) | $3,026,876        | $4,368,375     | $6,270,856       |

| 30 Years (2055) | $6,529,115        | $11,321,594    | $19,483,923      |



\### Additional Considerations

\- \*\*Dividends\*\*: VTI’s dividend yield is currently around 1.17% ($3.65 annually). Reinvesting dividends (as assumed) boosts returns via compounding. The dividend CAGR over the past 10 years is 6.91%, which could increase payouts over time.\[\](https://www.dripcalc.com/stocks/vti/)

\- \*\*Volatility\*\*: VTI’s 30-year standard deviation is 15.09%, indicating significant yearly fluctuations. For example, VTI returned -19.85% in 2022 but 32.62% in 2019.\[\](https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/vti-returns-by-year-from-2000-to-2025)

\- \*\*Economic Factors\*\*: Interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth will influence future returns. Higher inflation or rates could suppress stock prices, while strong economic growth could enhance them.\[\](https://financeworld.io/learn/vti-stock-price-prediction-what-to-expect-in-2025-2030/)

\- \*\*Forecasts\*\*: Some sources predict VTI reaching $415.83 by 2030 (7.1% CAGR from $307.02) or $700 by 2035 (8.6% CAGR from $311.07). These align with the conservative to moderate scenarios.\[\](https://coinpriceforecast.com/vti-stock)\[\](https://walletinvestor.com/fund-forecast/vti-fund-prediction)

\- \*\*Risks\*\*: Prolonged downturns (e.g., 2008’s -37.01% return) could delay growth. Diversification within VTI mitigates some risk, but market-wide declines affect it.\[\](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2025/07/01/1000-in-vti-could-turn-into/)\[\](https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/vti-returns-by-year-from-2000-to-2025)



\### Notes

\- The moderate 10% CAGR is a reasonable baseline given VTI’s long-term history and broad market exposure. The optimistic 12% reflects stronger recent performance but assumes continued favorable conditions.

\- These projections are estimates, not guarantees. Actual returns could fall outside these ranges due to unforeseen events.

\- Tax implications, fees (VTI’s expense ratio is 0.03%), and trading costs are not factored in but are minimal with VTI.

\- For context, a post on X suggested a $150,000 investment in VTI could double every 7.2 years (implying a \~10% CAGR), supporting the moderate scenario.



\### Final Answer

Based on historical data and reasonable assumptions, your $650,000 investment in VTI could be worth:

\- \*\*5 Years (2030)\*\*: \~$955,000–$1,145,000

\- \*\*10 Years (2035)\*\*: \~$1,403,000–$2,017,000

\- \*\*20 Years (2045)\*\*: \~$3,027,000–$6,271,000

\- \*\*30 Years (2055)\*\*: \~$6,529,000–$19,484,000



For a balanced expectation, the moderate scenario (10% CAGR) suggests $1.69M in 10 years, $4.37M in 20 years, and $11.32M in 30 years.

Wash Sale Question: Stock + Options Combo (PLTR example),1mldpo5,Anxious_Procedure545,2025-08-09 02:04:17,0,0.5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mldpo5/wash_sale_question_stock_options_combo_pltr/,"Looking for some help clarifying wash sale rules when holding stock and trading options on the same ticker (PLTR in this case).

My Situation:

I exercised in-the-money PLTR options earlier this year and now hold the stock as a long-term investment.

I’ve also been actively trading PLTR options throughout the year (calls/puts, weeklys).

I plan to stop trading PLTR options before Nov 30 to avoid wash sale issues.

I will continue holding my PLTR stock into next year.


My Question:

If I sell PLTR options at a loss in November, but keep holding PLTR stock, could that trigger a wash sale since the stock is still considered “substantially identical”?

I’m trying to avoid having those losses disallowed this year (i.e., avoid a wash sale that adds losses to my stock cost basis).

From what I understand:

If I sell the PLTR stock too, then I’m safe - loss is clean and allowed.

But if I keep holding the stock, my option losses might be disqualified due to the 30-day rule.

Gains aren’t affected,  just losses.

I sold a few hundred thousand dollars worth of shares of my personal brokerage investment portfolio to pay off the mortgage, student loans and credit card debts.

That way, the 2024 capital gains taxes were paid off this year and the rest will be paid off in next year's tax season.

**It got me thinking - have you sold stocks or other investments to generate cash to pay for something important to you? In the long run, how did things turn out?**

Reasons people typically sold stocks:

1. To protect profits: after huge gains in the market
2. To prevent further losses: poor-performing stocks
3. To reinvest in other stocks: exit poor positions and buy more of growing stocks
4. To stay all cash in fear of a recession: influence from the mainstream news
5. To pay off taxes
6. To wait out a US presidential term to end
7. To pay for a vacation
8. To pay off debts: *what I did*
9. To apply towards a mortgage down payment
10. To pay a car loan

*Without any debts, my net worth has crossed two milestones so far: target total net worth and total liquid net worth of a million dollars have been achieved. I hope to recover and surpass the personal brokerage account balance level I had in December 2024 just before I sold a few thousand dollars worth of shares to pay off all my debts. The hope is, if all goes according to plan, I'd have erased all my outstanding debts plus recovered the money in my personal brokerage investment within 1 yr vs continuing to pay my student loans, mortgage and credit card monthly for 19yrs, 15yrs(?) and 10yrs, respectively, if I continued paying the minimum payments only.*

It does not fit the comment space, and I thought it may be interesting for a larger audience than the comments from the post. Please note that I do not have any political affiliation, I am not even american, and I am only providing a semi-educated commentary about the FED's job.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------  
The FED has two mandates: maximum employment and low inflation (nowadays officially 2% [FED dual mandate](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate)).

One very simplistic way of thinking about the FED is the Taylor rule ([Taylor Rule wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_rule)): essentially, if the FED sees employment and inflation raising, it should raise rates in order to *cool* the economy. Vice versa, if employment and inflation are going down, it should lower rates in order to *heat* the economy.

This is econ 101. 

What is interesting is that, normally, the economy is mostly hit by demand shocks. We think about demand shocks as changes in the demand for goods, which, for a constant supply, increases inflation (prices are a point where demand and supply meet) and increases employment/lowers unemployment (to make more goods firms hire more labour).

Keeping rates systematically below a given point (what we call r\*), makes it so that when a demand shock hits: prices go up, unemployment goes down, labour is squeezed, so wages need to increase, which means prices go up and on and on. Effectively, this is what happened in the US - and globally - in the 70s ([the anatomy of double digit inflation](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c11462/c11462.pdf)).

Therefore, economists tend to think about the economy as a series of equilibrium: there is an equilibrium interest rate (r\*), an equilibrium unemployment rate (NAIRU or u\*), and many other fundamentals, which we call **stars**. There **stars** tend to move for several reasons. For example, an economy in which people have high rate of unionization may have a higher NAIRU than an economy with low unionization rates. Therefore, not all economies are the same, and not all stars are the same. Here is an example from a paper I like a lot, which tracks r\* in all major economies: [global trends in interest rates](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25039).

This is also econ 101.

There are (in my opinion) three sides of what has been going on in the US in the last 8 months.  
  
First, inflation is on an overall downward trend, but still far from the rate of 2% ([FED inflation](https://www.federalreserve.gov/economy-at-a-glance-inflation-pce.htm)). Normally, we would look at this as a trivia problem: inflation is higher than target, let's keep rates high. However, because the data we get tends to be late, we may also try to extrapolate its trend.

For example, the European Central Bank, which is basically the FED but for the majority of countries from the EU, lowered rates even when inflation was above 2%, and still managed to get it to target. You can see EA inflation [here](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/macroeconomic_and_sectoral/hicp/html/index.en.html) and rates [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECBDFR). This is because they saw it was on an overall downard trend, assumed that real inflation was going to go down anyway, and took a more aggressive stance. 

In October, t[he FED did the same](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF). The rates were higher than now, and had been lowered as the FED was afraid that inflation would have othewise quickly gone below 2%.

Second, his is where tariffs come into play. The Fed tracks inflation expectations from the SPF ([survey of professional forecasters](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/inflation-forecasts)). The professional forecasters are not extremely good at predicting what is going to happen, but they do capture the business sentiment fairly well. Looking at the median of the surveys, you may see that after Trump's election, inflation expectations start to rise again because of tariffs.

That is because tariffs are really tricky. They are not a *demand* shock like the one we talked about before. They are a *supply* (specifically *technology/productivity)* shock. Technology shocks are a type of shock that depresses the labour market while being inflationary. For example, a new cost saving tech is introduced to the market: this makes it so that products are cheaper, so people can buy more of them, and the labour market is doing good, but inflation is below its optimal value. Dealing with supply shocks is a nightmare for economists at the FED.

The problem with technology shocks is that the two sides of the Taylor rule - inflation and employment - are not going to the same direction. Currently, if you look at inflation (or in this case inflation expectations), by all means you are supposed to *increase* rates. Inflation is raising (2.2 in April vs 2.6 in June). Inflation expectations are also rising.

Third, employment. Until recently, our impression was that the labour market was doing good. If you look at the FED announcement, they cited lower demand for labour (which we track from [vacancies](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LMJVTTUVUSM647S)) and a lower labour supply (because of the new immigration policies), but overall growing [employment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) and a very low unemployment rate (you can put [unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) and [NAIRU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU) in a single chart and see that unemployment is below the NAIRU).

However, **the job revisions are signalling a recession incoming**.

\-----------------------            --------------  
Effectively, the FED has been served a hot potato.  On one side, you have a labour market which is ***not strong*** by any metric, which means you are supposed to **lower** the rates to support the economy.

On the other side, inflation will probably raise even more now that the tariffs are starting to effectively come in. Imagine a paradox in which all you buy is 100% imported. On average, inflation would be 15% compared to the previous month, and more compared to the previous year. While this is not the case, in a scenario in which inflation is already rising, adding tariffs on top is not a good idea.

So why do [analysts think the FED is going to cut rates in September ](https://www.reuters.com/business/jpmorgan-brings-forward-fed-rate-cut-forecast-september-2025-08-08/)?

It is because a recession is probably undergoing, and it is getting worse and worse by the day. On one side, this means that the little element that gets multiplied in the Taylor rule coefficient for the labour market gets higher. On the other side, randomly raising prices means overall lower economic activity. Basically, because during a recession people are buying less goods, the prices go down because there is a declining demand.

Remember the demand shock from before? Right now, the US economy is undergoing a large negative supply shock, and a semi-large negative demand shock. Both of them have negative effects on the labour market and overall economic activity. But they have contrasting effects on inflation. Realistically, the technology - tariff - shock will prevail on the demand - lower econ activity - in increasing inflation.

So, let's answer the question. Should the FED cut rates? I do not know. **But I know they will**. However, inflation will probably go back to the large levels we have seen during the pandemic.

\----------------------------------  
Finally, one bonus question:

Is Trump right when he says JPOW should have cut rates before? Basically, **no**.

The reason is very simple. Had JPOW cut rates before, inflation would have raised to over the current 2.6%, and the labour market would have been in slightly a better shape. However, the likelihood of managing inflation would have gone virtually to zero.

The portfolio seems to be doing fine. It beat the market over the past 12 months, with a lifetime annual return of 12.8%. Not terrible.  I am cautious, though: 58% of my holdings are blue chip stocks (large, reliable, stable). 

When broken down, it looks like this: 51% industrials, 14% Communications, 17% health care, everything else is in cash/bonds/treasuries/etc. All of it is domestic! I intentionally avoid real estate because I have more than enough exposure elsewhere. There are roughly 20 stocks: 7.4% in stock A, 8.2% in stock B, two positions that are double-digit percentages. Clearly, position sizing is something I should know more about. But, also, I'm skeptical here because if you look at every major investor, they have concentrations higher than that.

On top of that, the idea is thematic investing. Looking at politics and social trends, then making informed decisions based on that. That being said: my only rules involve financials (PE ratio, cash flow, etc) when moving in and out of positions. BUT, it lacks a rhythm and there is no rebalance strategy.

So, my question is: how can I learn how to structure my portfolio so its less haphazard? I am mostly a buy and hold value guy. Strong cash flow, low PE, and most pay a dividend. Anyway, I think it would be beneficial to read up on:

* asset allocation (Is there any math that dictates percentage of portfolio based on things like PE ratio, dividend, and/or other major metrics)
* sector exposure (especially when you are keeping your portfolio at 20-25 positions)
* I'm not a big fan of momentum or trends, BUT when it is time to rebalance, it would be nice to understand the parts that overlap my existing strategy.
* insights into non-US markets would likely be helpful, but that also means I'd need to understand currency and all that fun stuff.",2025-08-08,0.9812,Positive,"['PE', 'BUT', 'PE', 'PE', 'BUT', 'US']"

Fortinet Stock Analysis (-25% Price Drop),1ml1elh,Kredit-Carma,2025-08-08 17:26:23,1,0.53,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ml1elh/fortinet_stock_analysis_25_price_drop/,"
I recently did a deep dive on Fortinet, and here are my takeaways.

The stock recently got leveled after their revenue growth from a hardware refresh cycle underwhelmed wall street. The team gives very modest and reslistic guidance and doesn't celebrate their performance and instead gives a formulaic roadmap of their trajectory, product/service rollouts and mid term goals. 

Fortinet competes most directly with Palo Alto Networks but positions itself as a more budget-friendly option. For small and mid-sized businesses, Fortinet is often a primary cybersecurity solution (even though the market is fragmented and most companies have to use more than one cyber security companies services). In larger enterprises, it is more commonly used as a cost-effective firewall or SASE option for regional or secondary facilities, while the core network and main data centers are usually protected by Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler or Netskope. 

Fortinet is well-regarded for delivering high-quality firewalls that are both energy and cost efficient compared to competitors. This focus on performance per dollar has helped them build a massive customer base of around 700,000+, far ahead of Palo Alto’s roughly 90,000 customers. The trade-off is a much lower average revenue per customer. That large installed base is where their moat really sits today.

The growth opportunity for Fortinet is in upselling its existing SMB-heavy base into cloud-native SASE services and gradually shifting the business model toward higher-margin subscription revenue. Right now, the company still makes most of its money from hardware sales with cross-selling and upgrade cycles layered in. They most recently announced their upcoming move to SASE and view them self as a contender for the #1 position when it comes to SASE market share. 

In hardware firewalls, Fortinet holds about 50 percent of the global market by unit volume, making it the clear leader. By revenue share, Palo Alto leads, reflecting its higher prices and focus on large enterprises. Fortinet’s lower-cost positioning also gives them room to raise prices over time if they choose. Management has a track record of prioritizing customer satisfaction, often focusing on designing more energy and cost-efficient products to meet the needs of their customer base

It’s true that Fortinet was slower than peers to embrace cloud-native security, but it may not be too late. Many of their SMB customers have not fully moved to the cloud, and for a lot of them, switching to a different security ecosystem would be costly and disruptive. That inertia gives Fortinet some breathing room to catch up. They will probably not be able to convert enterprise companies to use FTNT in their core data centers. But once again, they work great as a secondary solution.

Situation: Former federal employee. Saved hard as hell, took deferred retirement a few years ago. Living a comfortable life with plenty of money for travel and fun (my husband also took early retirement). Can't touch TSP for 11 more years. TSP is huge. Didn't realize I'd be able to retire as early as I did when I started working/saving; probably should've put more into a Roth in hindsight, but government employees, as a rule, usually plan to work well beyond the point where they can withdraw from their TSP (at least they used to).

Curveball: Cancer. I'm starting chemo soon and the odds of beating this are good-- they say I may live as long as if I'd never been diagnosed (my family seems to average about 75-80 before kicking the bucket, and I've always been perfectly healthy and in great shape), but I've seen too many people ""beat cancer"" only to find out a few years down the road that it came back with a vengeance and now it's the end. I'd like to spend some of that TSP money traveling with family and friends, and make my nieces' and nephews' lives more comfortable as they enter college and adulthood.

Plan: I want to roll over part of (or maye my whole?) TSP into an IRA and leave it there for five years in a very low-risk investment, such as a HYSA, so that, after five years, I can start moving some into a Roth and withdraw the contributions (paying taxes on the contribution witdrawals, obviously). This would mean I don't have to wait the full 11 years before accessing my TSP.

But there's one huge risk that’s consistently downplayed by investors: TSMC’s geographic exposure to Taiwan, and more specifically, the growing possibility of a Chinese invasion.

Most investors seem to consider it highly unlikely. But if you listen to defense experts, geopolitical analysts, and even governments, they see it as a real risk with real probability. This isn’t just noise or fearmongering.

TSMC is one of the most important companies in the global semiconductor supply chain. If conflict breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it won’t just be bad for them. It could disrupt the entire industry. ASML would lose a key customer. Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm would all be cut off from advanced chip supply. And yes, TSMC is building fabs in the US and Japan, but those won’t match Taiwan’s capabilities for years.

The bullish projections for the chip sector almost always assume political stability around Taiwan and China. But what if that assumption fails?

I’m not saying semiconductors are a bad investment. They’ve been some of the top performers over the past decade. But I do think many portfolios are overexposed to this single point of geopolitical risk.

We can’t predict macro events. But we can choose how much risk we take. Personally, I try to avoid putting too much weight in the chip sector. I prefer companies that would be less impacted if a worst-case scenario plays out. Sure, the returns might be lower, but so are the potential losses.

Just some thoughts. Curious to hear how others are thinking about this. Is the market underestimating the Taiwan risk?",2025-08-08,-0.9335,Negative,"['TSMC', 'ASML', 'AI', 'TSMC', 'TSMC', 'ASML', 'AMD', 'TSMC', 'US']"
Long Term Capital Gains Tax Minimization Strategy,1mkteh6,sharpie20,2025-08-08 12:06:50,2,0.54,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mkteh6/long_term_capital_gains_tax_minimization_strategy/,"Wanted to get your feedback on a tax strategy based on this hypothetical situation to minimize my taxes and avoid wash sale rules (other rule I'm not considering?), while also getting similar market exposure:

Sell Lot 1: $SPY +$100,000 gain (holding for 1+ year)  
Sell Lot 2: $SPY -$51,650 loss (holding for 1+ year)

Net Long Term Gain: $48,350

Buy: $48,350 $VOO, a similar position but buying a different ETF would not trigger wash sale rules

This would save me about $7,252.50 in federal taxes for the year. Is doing the above every year an effective way to reduce my taxes over the long term? Is there an ordinary income (assume I make $200,000 from my normal job) or other piece I'm missing?

What counts as an “investment?” Is any of this binding?

It sounds like a feel-good headline that allows Trump to tout a win, but makes little material difference to Apple’s existing spending. In exchange, Apple gets the tariff exemptions it wants without actually giving up much.

From CNBC:

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/apples-tim-cook-convinced-trump-to-drop-made-in-usa-iphone-for-now.html

“Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn’t break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple’s suppliers are contractually required to keep the information secret. Apple doesn’t report how much its new campuses in Austin or North Carolina end up costing.

Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.

Apple said in February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.

In Apple’s fiscal 2024, Apple spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses, and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.

Teffler said she didn’t think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple’s profitability, especially since it already has existing relationships with the various companies such as Corning.”",2025-08-07,0.9343,Positive,"['CNBC', 'TV']"

Boy, was I wrong.

The combination of rising interest rates, AI bubble concerns, and regulatory pressure has absolutely hammered my holdings. What I thought was a conservative approach to growth investing turned into a masterclass in concentration risk.

My current dilemma: Do I start rotating into value stocks or defensive sectors? Do I double down on my thesis that these companies will recover? Or do I take the L and move to index funds like I probably should have done from the start?

I don't understand defensive stocks or sectors,1mk2wc1,imnottobright,2025-08-07 15:19:06,0,0.36,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mk2wc1/i_dont_understand_defensive_stocks_or_sectors/,"Can someone explain to me the purpose of why a retail investor would want to invest in defensive stocks if they think there is going to be a market downturn?  To me it seems like an incredibly pointless thing to do.

I can understand why a fund manager who has to be 100% invested in equities would want defensive stocks, but as a retail investor where I don't have that mandate.  If I truly had a high conviction that an economic downturn was coming, defensive stocks have less beta to the market, they are not inverse the market.  Which means I could achieve the same results by simply trimming my current positions and holding it in cash and if the crash did come I would have liquidity to buy back in at a lower valuation and not change my thesis or have a taxable event.  

Now some people might say thats timing the market, but if you are rotating into a defensive sector you are already trying to time the market, you are just doing so in a very odd way.    

If I had such strong convictions that a major market shift was coming that I thought I could time or avoid, I would trim my positions and put it in cash, bonds, inverse the market, and wait for a buying opportunity.  

If my long term thesis is that I want to hold the entire market or the S&P500....and I think that short time volatility might be coming, why would I want to re-work my entire investing thesis, as opposed to merely trimming risk off and continuing my current thesis?  ",2025-08-07,0.3654,Positive,[]

Here has been our discussions and possible plans to use the money and regarding mortgage interest rates above 6%.
1) pay the house in full, looking at a house around 350k-400k, and eliminate all of that interest. Main expenses would be property tax, insurance and utilities. This would mean lowest of living costs and allow for more disposable income to then reinvest else where, or just spend.
2) pay some of the house, $200k-ish, mortgage the rest, then invest some of the leftover cash to help offset mortgage costs and lower monthly income liability for covering the mortgage.
3) put all the cash in a relatively safe investment like SGOV and take the interest gained each month minus taxes to cover the entire mortgage with some paid extra each month to payoff sooner.

Most investors recommend Mutual Funds, Index Funds, ETFs, High Yield Savings accounts...anything but individual stocks. 

At the essence of it, aren't some of these just a collection of individual stocks? Essentially a Mutual Fund manager invests in individual stocks albeit not as many as Index Funds' but of the 300-500 stocks the Fund manager buys, they tend to weigh, say the top 10, heavily vs the rest of the stocks.

I prefer individual stocks. Here're some reasons why:

1. Low cost to start vs mutual funds; not complicated to get in vs real estate or a business 
2. Dollar cost averaging enables buying of more shares than prior during market fluctuations (dips)
3. Sell only shares of stocks which are no longer growing without affecting the other stocks
4. Compounding daily/monthly/annually with no cap on % gained unlike High Yield Savings (HYSA) 
5. Buy new rapidly growing companies to earn remarkably higher returns 
6. No brokerage fees
7. No transaction fees 
8. No management fees
9. Free shares from reinvested dividends 
10. Free shares from stock splits 
11. Tax deferred until sold vs HYSA
12. Principal + capital gains continue to compound as long as you don't sell
13. Taxed at a lower longterm capital gains tax rate (15%) vs ordinary rate for HYSA
14. Fungible: sell 1 or some shares of the same stock via FIFO or LIFO strategy to save on taxes
15. Information to research a stock & company’s performance is readily available online to help you anticipate likely future performance (granted nobody can predict the future!)
16. You may come into contact in real life with the company’s products or services to use as a derivative of how you assess how the company's doing
17. If you buy good companies, you can buy and forget as a longterm investor. Nice and boring.
18. Ultimately, it takes very little time to add to your position because no additional research is needed
19. Unlike trading the S&P 500 mini directly on the futures market where losses are catastrophic resulting in an immediate margin call by end of day, stocks can recover their losses during wild market fluctuations over several days, weeks or months
20. It is fun!

Edit: a huge bonus = 0% capital gains tax for couples earning less than $94,050/yr if filing jointly!

Important because I definitely don’t want to zero in on that number and sacrifice a bunch of gains to just get to minimum.

Currently have my rollover and Roth IRA projecting 6.5% real returns and 401k at 4.5% to account for more fees, holding more bonds here eventually, etc. All of that is done in real $ including future contributions then converted to nominal $ using 3% inflation to easily track where my account should be at.

My question is if I’m hitting the contribution goals and have a return much higher than planned, say 20%, should I direct some of the excess returns into bonds then in negative- below planned years move the bonds back into to stocks?

I’m against holding bonds at a young age but this would boost money I have to buy dips with and would be 0% bonds in bear markets. Overall I’m thinking this probably drags returns down but if I could lock in like 10% real returns I’d sacrifice some upside. Not sure if I locked this in over like a big decade that did more and had bonds to buy up dips in a worse period if the lost growth from hedging makes up for the lower returns in a great period if that makes sense.

In investing, this can hurt our performance, where instead of sticking to a plan, we second guess ourselves. We chase the hot new assets because of hype, we delay rebalancing because we are unsure, we pick 20+ funds thinking we are diversified... But we end up diluting exposure, paying higher fees, and reacting emotionally to the markets. We tell ourselves that we are optimizing, but in reality we are just getting overwhelmed.

So, what we can do to be calmer is the following:   
\- simplify our asset menu of choices  
\- write down strict allocation rules ahead of time  
\- automate where possible through DCA

I bought my house for 76k in 2018, and it is now worth at least 200-250k. unfortunately it still needs a decent amount of work, such as 2 renovated bathrooms , a new roof (within the next few years), a kitchen renovation,  among some other things. I was hoping to turn this house into a duplex eventually but that would require building a whole new kitchen upstairs from scratch as well. not to mention a lot of other ""here and theres"" (new flooring in some rooms, maybe new stairs, furnish the basement a little, a new fence in the yard ,etc). I am aware this work will take years. I am willing to do it all over time. I plan to do as much DIY as possible to save money, but I lack motivation which is my biggest obstacle. I wanted to take a loan out right away, fully finish my renovations, and get into renting, but i was told by many redditors that was a bad idea and im starting to agree.

so what do I do? 
I will literally take any and all advice that you think is valuable. be honest, be brutal, but help me. I want to live a comfortable life, I dont want to fuck up what I have going for me. how do I make the best of this? my budgeting and saving skills are okay, but subpar in my opinion. I try not to spend but I splurge a little more than I should. help! 

thank you for reading if you read this far, youre a goat. (cross posted)

edit: i was able to purchase my own house with lawsuit money from when I was a kid. I wasn't allowed to touch it until I was 18, and with the help of my dad, we bought a house and put it in my name. he now lives with my sister a few blocks away in her own home (she's on a mortgage tho). hope that clears a bit up!

Looking for some advice on how best to allocate my income and investments. My wife and I are beginning to look for a home as first time home buyers, and I don’t want to overcommit my savings towards a down payment if it makes more sense to invest it.

I have around $100k in a HYSA and was planning on using about half of that as part of a DP. We also have around $24k in a joint savings that will go towards a DP and about $20k total split between my wife’s personal savings and family help. 

We are looking for homes in the $400-500k range. Combined we make about $150k gross. We currently rent and its manageable enough that I am able to contribute 20% of my gross salary towards 401k with a 5% company match. I also have a Roth ira that I am investing in. 

401k balance $75,000 (target date investment fund)
Roth IRA $27,000 (VOO)

Our total debt combined is about $16k and total monthly payments towards our debt around $1100. We are just starting to make larger payments towards debt before we take on a mortgage. 

Does it make more sense to use less of my $100k savings as a DP and instead invest it in a low cost ETF? Id like to keep an emergency fund too of around $25k. I would love to have $50k in a taxable brokerage with $25k in emergency and $25k as a down payment for a home, but then were looking at 10% down instead of 15% for our budget/ price range on a home.

Any thoughts on how best to manage our finances?

Debunking Investing Myths,1mjikx0,Guy_PCS,2025-08-06 22:19:32,0,0.33,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mjikx0/debunking_investing_myths/,"# “Investing is Like Gambling”

Unlike gambling, which relies on chance, investing is about compounding growth and has historically rewarded long-term commitment with positive returns.

Consider the probabilities of winning various casino games:

* Craps: \~50%
* Blackjack: \~49%
* Roulette: \~47% to 49%
* Baccarat: \~44% to 46%

Then, consider the probabilities of S&P 500 returns over…

* 5-year periods since 1955: 81.4%
* 10-year periods since 1960: 92.3%
* 15-year periods since 1965: 100%
* 20-year periods since 1970: 100%

# “Investing is Only for the Rich”

The power of compounding can grow small, regular investments over time. Compounding, coupled with advances in technology (like fractional shares) helps make investing accessible to a wide range of income levels.

# “Holding Cash is Better Than Investing”

Holding cash might feel safe, but over time inflation erodes its purchasing power.

Investing cash in a money market fund can help mitigate the effects of inflation, but it doesn’t generate significant growth. In fact, as illustrated in the example below, oftentimes money market funds merely cancel out inflation, resulting in net-zero real growth.

# “Market Timing Is Key to High Returns”

Many believe timing is key, but missing just a few top-performing days significantly impacts long-term returns.

# “Now is the Wrong Time to Invest”

Have you ever thought the market was simply too high to invest in?

Just like the myth that “market timing is key to high returns,” fretting about whether or not the present moment is the wrong time to invest can be detrimental, especially if the market is at an all-time high.",2025-08-06,0.9423,Positive,[]

AMD (AMD) $162, 5% lower after a decent beat and guidance and upgrades from analysts.

**Looks like a classic sell on news after a meteoric 100% rise this year.**

**Overall, I had trimmed 30% of my position on Friday, and don’t plan to buy that back. Planning to hold on to the rest.**

1. AMD Q2 revenue of $7.685B, up 32% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter,  $270M beat over $7.415B estimates.
2. Better guidance for Q3 of $8.7B, up 13% quarter-over-quarter and up 28% year-over-year V consensus of  $8.323B. Mostly on data center growth from M1355 ramp up.
3. This does not include projected $1.5B of lost China revenue, which is still awaiting approval.
4. Market share gains over Intel in CPUS from EPYC server chips, and Ryzen client chips.
5. Gaming Radeon GPUs would have been better if not for supply constraints.
6. The weaker segments, embedded is finally turning around, while gaming will remain flat in Q3
7. Weak margins remain a key concern though, which has always been AMD’s weakness and reason for the poorer multiple and lower valuation.
8. There is widespread expectation that AMD would be able to raise AI GPU prices, which are still substantially cheaper than Nvidia’s Blackwell’s but there was no explicit confirmation during the earnings call - perhaps a reason for the drop,
9. Benchmark reiterated its Buy rating on AMD PT $210 from $170. KeyBanc maintained its Sector Weight rating on AMD. Oppenheimer kept its Perform rating on AMD's stock.Meanwhile, Mizuho raised the price target on AMD's stock to $183 from $175.

•Is there a meaningful benefit to splitting between SPLG and SCHB compared to just holding one?

•For someone already holding SCHD, is it more common to add to it or to keep it separate from broader market holdings?

My understanding is that in general, tracking stocks like this have no voting rights and no claim to residual earnings.

My first stock knocked it out of the park and posted like 50% gains so I leave this week in the green, but I am baffled by what happened this morning.

I used Robinhood margin to buy about $20,000 of Charles River stock (CRL) with an uninformed opinion that they would post an earnings beat.  I bought the stock at $165 on August 5.  Charles River announced an earnings beat and improved guidance before the market opened on August 6, and the stock went up to $179 in pre-market.  I was sleeping at the time, and opened my phone to find my stop limit order of $160 had executed and I was already out of the stock.

A few points/questions:

\- I guess it's my fault I didn't sell when it spiked early in the morning.  I was sleeping and checked at market open.  I feel like some algorithmic traders had a similar view and much better execution than myself - somebody definitely sold at $175+ like I had intended to.   Are massive pre-market swings common now?  I mean the stock lost \~15% of its capitalization after an EPS beat and improved guidance.

\- I was targeting $10/share profit and planning to exit the stock quickly to avoid any margin loan interest.  I missed my window to sell.  Is there a way to structure my investment so I could have had a piece of action at that price like I intended.  Does interactive brokers allow bracket orders that execute in pre-/post- market trading?

\- I suppose the good news is that I was correct and there's an outstanding buying opportunity right now at $155/share, but I want to first learn from this correct-guess-miss.

	•	Revenue Beat: Q2 revenue hit $7.7B (+32% YoY), beating estimates of $7.4B, driven by strong client and gaming segments.

	•	EPS In Line: Adjusted EPS was $0.48, broadly in line with expectations, though margins compressed due to a $800M China-related export charge.

	•	Data Center Miss: Data center revenue rose 14% YoY to $3.2B, slightly below expectations ($3.3B), impacted by MI308 sales restrictions.

	•	Strong Q3 Guidance: AMD guided Q3 revenue to $8.7B, above consensus ($8.28B), led by AI chip ramp (MI350) and client/gaming strength.

Stock is down 8% today but I believe the market has wildly overreacted on the data center miss and the quarter over quarter decline.

Not going to get into the details and my thesis today, but beneath all the noise yesterday was this gem.

The release of ROCm 7.0 - AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s moat that is CUDA.

AMD is positioning itself to reap the benefits of the inference computing cost being the majority of where capex will be spent in the future on AI.

Think of Nvidia as providing the supercomputers for generating the weather models, but AMD wants to be the iPhone that just shows the weather app.

A bit of tangent but getting back to ROCm 7.0 - it’s 3.5x more powerful than its prior version.  That’s a significant leap forward and shows that AMD will be gaining traction with hyperscalers like META.

It’s not a matter of if, but when. That’s why I am doubling my AMD position today at these discounted prices.

Bought in May 2024 -$59

They are the USA's largest egg producer. Vertically integrated, no debt, and control basically their whole supply chain. People will always by eggs. Very conservative financials. Started acquiring companies that have value added potential and will improve efficiency.

Modine Manufacturing Co. (MOD)

Bought in July 2024 at 106

Supplier to AI industry. Pivoted hard to Cooling data centers from the automotive sector. Still invested heavily in ICE and EV production. Even if AI flops the existing centers will need cooled and they're fist in this new industry. High R and D and profits. Paying down debt.

Microsoft

Bought in Sep 2024 at $416

Out of all the Tech stocks I felt this was the most resilient. 3 big moats, good profits, and is the leader in a lot of industries. They seem to be most focused on returning value to shareholders and not developing far away technologies hoping to hit it big.

Dollar General Corp. (DG)

Bought in Feb 2024 at $69

First time i ever found the bottom and bought. I believe in their plan and leadership. The focus on growth when interest rates are low and optimizing stores and paying down dept when rates go up. Their modular store design is genius. They have 10 ""premade"" stores and review demographic needs and adjust store layout based on demand. Store sales have been improving and the stock has recovered. Dollar stores typically do well in recessions.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Bought in April 2025 for $156

I work in healthcare and believe in the company and their products. Easiest company to deal with and have a huge lead in several areas (impella). Huge R&D. Return value to shareholders. Heath care usually does ok in a recession. Big lawsuits are settled. Buying up start ups and keeping debt reasonable. They hire industry specialist and not MBAs and i love that.

Ecolab, Inc. (ECL)

Bought in March 2024 for $222

Supplies chemicals for water treatment. High debt but decent moat and very stable cash flow. There's not alot of people in the industry and the cash barrier is quite high. Exports are up despite tariffs. Long term debt is somewhat mitigated by long term contracts. Several future energy initiatives like nuclear and solar-thermal will lean heavily on their chemicals.

Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK)

Bought today

Stock is down due to things beyond their control. Not worried about the overall market, factories will continue to be automated and I'm buying for the long term not next quarter. They are focused on high end manufacturing and even if the stock market tanks its cheaper to pay robots then people.

With similar valuations revolving around $90-$120, and Nvidia’s current price being $178, $NVDA has almost zero upside.

Aurora Innovation is emerging as a leading player in autonomous trucking software and hardware, already conducting real-world testing on major U.S. freight routes.

⸻

Key Highlights • Cash on hand: $1.15–1.2B • Burn rate: $142M per quarter (~$600–700M annually) • Runway: ~6–7 quarters (18–22 months) at the current burn rate • Next steps to extend runway: Reduce burn, raise new funds, or both

⸻

Strategic Partnerships

Aurora has built strong alliances to accelerate autonomous trucking commercialization. Partnerships include: • Nvidia & Continental – hardware and software development for autonomous systems • Uber Freight, FedEx, Hirschbach, PACCAR, Ryder, Schneider, Volvo – logistics and trucking ecosystem collaborations

⸻

Founding Team • Chris Urmson – Former CTO of Google’s self-driving team (Waymo) • Sterling Anderson – Former head of Tesla Autopilot • Drew Bagnell – Former head of Uber’s autonomy and perception team

⸻

Current Testing • Test runs between Houston ↔ Dallas • Recently started El Paso ↔ Phoenix route (1,000 miles / 14 hours) • Advantage: This route exceeds the FMCSA Hours of Service limit (max 11 driving hours per day), giving autonomous trucks a major legal efficiency advantage.

I’m a 22 year old who has, over the past few years, been taking control of my finances to set myself up for the future.

After thorough research on platforms, I’m planning to invest long-term through InvestEngine, using a stocks and shares ISA and SIPP. Initial contribution of £300/month (£150 each) and increasing this over time (every year by £50-£100 in each until happy).

The main two I’ve been looking at are SPDR MSCI ACWI (ACWI, 0.12% TER,  IE00B44Z5B48) and Vanguard FTSE All-World (VWRP, 0.22% TER, IE00BK5BQT80). I’ve also been considering Invesco FTSE All-World (FWRG, TER 0.15%, IE000716YHJ7). I’m also open to ANY suggestions. 

My goal is simple long-term growth, 100% stocks, accumulating, global diversification. 

I understand VWRP has more holdings (3,600 vs 2,200) and includes more mid-caps than SSAC. Though I know mid-caps have historically outperformed, I’m not sure how significant that is here, since they only make up a portion of the ETF.

In turn, I’d end up with a slightly more diversified portfolio with VWRP, but not sure if that’s enough to justify the higher 0.22%? 

I’m leaning towards SSAC due to the lower fee, but just wanted to run it through this sub before I do. It just seems as if SPDR isn’t on the radar, wondering if I’m missing something? 

I may have made a few mistakes in this post, so please let me know if anything I’ve mentioned isn’t correct! Thanks in advance, looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Buying Foreign Inflation-Protected Bonds as a US Investor?,1mi3njz,mh211,2025-08-05 08:31:36,3,0.67,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mi3njz/buying_foreign_inflationprotected_bonds_as_a_us/,"I'm about 10 years from retirement and have been slowly building a ladder of individual TIPS to hold to maturity to cover basic expenses between retirement and claiming Social Security (roughly 2035 to 2050).  Now that it's clear that the current US regime will fire statisticians that make it look bad, I'm reconsidering whether US TIPS will be a reliable hedge against inflation over the near to medium term.

Do any US investors on this sub buy foreign inflation-protected bonds?  ETFs available for this purpose seem to have relatively high expense ratios, and of course you're stuck with the duration of whatever the given fund has chosen.  And as far as buying individual foreign bonds to hold to maturity, (1) I'm not sure the extent to which you can do that from a US-based Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard account, (2) there's currency risk, and (3) deciding which bonds to buy from which countries seems like a bit of a headache.

Other than foreign inflation-hedged bonds, I seem to have two options.  First, pause purchase of new TIPS for a few years and put all new money into equities, accepting increased volatility in exchange for something that's a more reliable inflation hedge.

Second, make no changes.  Continue buying TIPS as previously planned, because there's no cost-effective way to mitigate the risk of political manipulation of the CPI calculation (or maybe trusting that the market will incorporate that risk into the purchase price for TIPS on the secondary market going forward).  This has the virtue of being the least market-time-y option.

This is related to an ancient story called Plato's Cave: where people are chained, watching shadows, and mistaking them for the real world. Nowadays, the cave is the screen, and the shadows are the financial news noise.

\- Read company filings

\- Zoom out on the chart  
\- Ask what is real behind the news

I may be wrong, and as ever do your own research.  
  
I think we can all agree that something doesn’t feel right about the current state of the US stock market.  
   
Valuations are stretched, fundamentals appear increasingly irrelevant, and AI hype is propping up a handful of tech giants that now dominate the S&P 500. There is talk again on Wall Street about a bubble, and for good reason. While institutional investors still drive most of the volume, retail investors have become a cultural force in this market, and that influence is rarely discussed with enough seriousness.  
   
The retail mantra of VOO and chill, buy the dip, market only go up etc, isn't just a meme anymore, it's a way of life for millions who are sleep walking into a situation they don't fully appreciate or understand. Social media influencers, YouTube finance channels, and TikTok traders have made passive investing and perpetual optimism trendy. With the widespread adoption of trading platforms that you can use on your phone at an instant, and zero-commission trading, newer investors are buying broad market ETFs and big tech names without always understanding the risks, or even the underlying businesses.  
   
Tesla and Palantir are good examples . These stocks trade more on narrative than on cash flow or earnings. The enthusiasm is rooted in future potential, especially around AI, not today's performance. And in many cases, these companies are simply selling AI tools to each other or hoarding compute capacity, rather than delivering real consumer-facing monetization. There’s a circular logic at play, in that tech firms are bidding up each other’s valuations with massive cash piles, creating the illusion of demand and progress.  
   
Meanwhile, under the surface, the macro picture is getting gloomier. Recession indicators are flashing amber, slowing growth, falling real wages, weak consumer confidence. Layoffs are rising, particularly in white-collar and tech sectors, and corporate earnings are showing signs of strain. Add to that geopolitical tensions, unpredictable trade policies, and potential tariffs that could shock supply chains. AI, the very force driving the market, is going to accelerate job losses. If you disagree with this you are blind.  
   
Then there’s Trump, who seems intent of crashing the world economy. Tariffs are almost impossible to defend if you are an advocate of global economic growth, and now he is applying massive pressure to the fed to cut interest rates. And with the latest jobs report, a rate cut might well be coming. A scenario where rates are cut too early, or money is printed again in the face of economic weakness, could easily reignite inflation, especially if tariffs are layered on top. That sets up the possibility of a stagflationary cycle not unlike the 1970s, slow growth, high prices, and little room for monetary maneuvering.  
  
So what happens next? I don’t claim to know for sure, but here’s what I think will happen:  
   
Inflation will spike after the fed is forced to cut rates and tariffs start to bite. Consumer spending dries up. The AI bubble starts to burst as people realise that there is no immediate and widespread monetization route to the masses. Big tech valuations, propped up by over enthusiasm and the greater fool theory, collapse. What follows is a grinding downturn... not necessarily a 2008-style collapse, but possibly a long period of stagnation and disillusionment, for as long as 10 years. I believe the start of the downturn will happen some time in the next 12 months.  
   
This isn’t a call to panic. It’s a call for realism. Passive investing is powerful, but it's not immune to cycles. The blind faith in “stock goes up” is exactly the kind of sentiment that tends to mark market tops, and has been seen many times throughout history.

The big differences are: 

1. Expense ratios (AVNM and DFAX are about equal but more expensive than VXUS)
2. The [returns](https://portfolioslab.com/tools/stock-comparison?d=e54c257) for AVNM > DFAX > VXUS which offsets the expense ratio 
3. In terms of liquidity and AUM: VXUS > DFAX >> AVNM

That worked for the last cycle. But the underlying assumptions are starting to rot.

Fiscal and monetary policy have merged in practice, if not in name. The US is running structurally high deficits in peacetime, with no political appetite for austerity. Demographics are slowing, labor is tight, and the Fed is trapped between managing inflation optics and funding the Treasury.

If that’s directionally correct, then the real risk isn’t another 2008. It’s something closer to an inflationary recession - stagflation with political dysfunction. The kind of scenario where bonds don’t hedge, equities de-rate, and the market begins repricing money itself.

Traditional portfolios aren’t built for that. They’re priced for a continuation of the post-Volcker paradigm. They assume trust, continuity, and policy efficacy. All of which look increasingly fragile.

Digital assets sit awkwardly in this context - not as a clean hedge, but as a reflexive proxy for declining faith in fiat institutions. Not because they’re intrinsically valuable, but because they’re perceived as outside the system.

None of this is an argument for crypto exposure in itself. But it’s worth asking if traditional monetary mechanisms have been changing to adapt to a non-fiat world, why haven’t our portfolios?",2025-08-03,-0.5166,Negative,['US']

I am in my mid twenties, and only recently understood what investing truly means. 

For the past 2 years I had a small wealth-simple portfolio with about 1700$ in it. Invested into a few random stocks and etf that I had passively heard of and put some money into. 

That 1700$ fluctuated between 1300 and 2000$ for about a year until I decided to take a more active role in my investments and try to actually learn how it’s done. 

I deposited another 5k into my wealthsimple, but instead of picking stocks by gut feeling, I started thinking more strategically. 

First I started looking into investment books, trying to get my “KNOWLEDGE” up. Then I realized that institutional investing is a whole ass university degree and with my job and my actual degree in progress, I didn’t have time to sit down and read dozens of books and self teach an entire trade. 

So I got chatgpt premium (I bet I lost you here, but hear me out):

The knowledge in them is real. And having access to them with real curation from gpt has been my edge. The reason I have 18% returns ytd. Really from April since that’s when I got active with it. 

Chat gpt does not pick the stocks for me, I pick them based on my own instincts, common sense, and my perceived market sentiments.

But chat gpt acts as my unbiased personal researcher. My pocket brain. I give it my picks, alongside their financials (reports, price action w/ time range) and gpt runs the numbers and compares it to what’s important in the books. 

It uses minimum outside searching by instruction and focuses solely on using the uploaded material. 

It helps me decide whether I do invest or not and by how much. I.e: “ideally this would be a small speculative play in your portfolio with less than 5% of total funds allocated into it” type shit. 

Whoever reads this, don’t give your brain to chat gpt, but do use it to give your own brain a boost. That’s the correct way to use AI. Don’t cheat with it, use it to be better. 

This strategy of mine, WILL make you money over the long term. Pick stocks right, don’t listen to ANYONE, collect all available information and paint the bigger picture with it. You can spend hours or days doing yourself, or you can facilitate the research via Ai.

Wealthfront Aggressive Portfolio vs. DIY VOO - is global diversification and tax-loss harvesting really worth it?,1mgptgy,RandomOrange3,2025-08-03 17:58:06,0,0.5,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mgptgy/wealthfront_aggressive_portfolio_vs_diy_voo_is/,"**Quick profile:** early-30s, dual-income household in VHCOL, high earners but *very* much not rich yet. We automate a healthy chunk of savings every month and I’m trying to decide whether to keep those dollars at Wealthfront or move them to a self-directed brokerage.

  
What I’m seeing

* **Wealthfront “Aggressive” Risk Score 10 Portfolio**
   * \~90 % global equities, 10 % alts (REITs, commodities)
   * 0.25 % advisory fee + fund expense ratios
   * Tax-loss harvesting + automatic rebalancing
* **DIY VOO (S&P 500) approach**
   * 0.03 % ER, zero advisory fee
   * Rebalance manually a couple times a year, no fancy TLH

**5-year total returns (to July 2025)**

* Wealthfront Aggressive: **\~60 %**
* S&P 500 / VOO: **\~103 %**



That’s a **40+ percentage-point gap**, and it has me questioning whether the extra diversification is actually paying off - or if I’m just paying for under-performance.  


# Questions for you all

1. **Anyone else on Wealthfront?** How do you stomach sticking with it when US-centric indexes keep pulling ahead?
2. **Global diversification**: Is the academic case (“don’t bet it all on one country”) still compelling in a world where the US dominates tech and profits?
3. **Tax-loss harvesting**: For those who left Wealthfront, did you miss automated TLH?

Bearish on Tesla - tell me why I am wrong!,1mgl5qe,crankygiraffe,2025-08-03 14:50:05,0,0.33,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mgl5qe/bearish_on_tesla_tell_me_why_i_am_wrong/,"I own a model Y and a few Tesla stocks but I am increasingly finding it challenging to see how the current valuation is sensible.

- Cars - Margin pressure is not going away. Sit in a BYD car and you will know why. Tesla remains strong but will not have market dominance especially as both legacy, Chinese and Korean makers catch up. Look at market share in EU and China. Superchargers are great but still are primarily used during trips. I did a roadtrip in Germany and every place I stayed in had a charger. Used superchargers twice and they were 20% occupancy. My take is you add the market cap of bmw, Mercedes and VW and add a buffer you are looking at 200b.
- Robotaxi - there is potential here but seriously they have competition. Also assume Tesla Robotaxi is 50% the size of Uber (which is a globally scaled brand and did 11 billion trips and has a thriving food delivery business) the market cap is 100b
- Optimus prime - at best it's a 10b valuation because it's so early in it's product life cycle. Google and look at the competition. The Chinese are a formidable force with immense support from their government.
- Solar - it's cool, but at this point it's a primarily US product with competition.

Overall, if I am being generous, it's a $400b company. 

Tell me what justifies the $1t market cap. So many people can't be wrong, so I must be missing something really basic. Some analysts are saying it will almost double from current levels. ",2025-08-03,0.9824,Positive,"['BYD', 'EU', 'VW', 'US']"

I’d love to own a (small) house one day, I’ve been renting since I was 17 and I’m done with the insecurities and making landlords richer and me poorer.

I think I have about 10 years for a bank to grant me a mortgage (which might be a bit tight to worth investing for that time?) but I might be wrong (I’ve also read that (in Belgium) banks sometimes take 70 y/o as end of mortgage age as okay).

I’m in doubt wether to save up for a downpayment as fast as I can or invest (in eft) and see how that’ll grow and hope to end a bit higher for the downpayment or even not buy a house but have less insecurities because my capital is higher (so keep renting and investing)

Is there really a market correction coming next week?,1mggpm9,naiveoutlier,2025-08-03 11:15:23,0,0.37,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mggpm9/is_there_really_a_market_correction_coming_next/,"Hey everyone,

I'm seeing all the usual talk about an imminent market dip, with many YouTubers predicting a 10% correction. However, when I look at the current sentiment and data, I'm a bit skeptical.

Here's why I think we might not see a major drop next week:

*  The Dip Demand Is Huge: The ""buy the dip"" mentality feels stronger than ever. So many people feel like they missed the last rally and are just sitting on the sidelines, waiting for any chance to get in. It seems like any real dip would be bought up almost instantly.

*  We Already Dropped: The market moved down on Friday. Was that the pullback everyone was waiting for?

* Good News from Bad News: The revised jobs data was a negative surprise, but this makes a Fed rate cut in September much more likely. Historically, that's bullish for stocks.
*  Fundamentals: The recent earnings season was actually quite solid for most companies.
*  Risk Indicators Are Calm: Even Bitcoin's drop seems to have stabilized as I'm writing this. Usually, when there's genuine fear, crypto is one of the first things to fall hard.
*  Past ""Fake Outs"": We recently had dip scares from the attack on Iran and the 30% EU tariff headlines, but the market seems to have completely digested that news already.

I'm not saying a big dip can't happen, but it feels like there's still time until a major one comes. For next week, I'm expecting things to be more or less flat, even with Europe being a bit more volatile than the US markets.

What do you think? Am I missing a major catalyst, or is the ""imminent crash"" story just noise for now?",2025-08-03,-0.9746,Negative,"['EU', 'US']"

She has maybe 15k in a savings account earning like 0.5% interest and that's literally it. No 401k, no IRA, nothing. Should I help her set up a Roth IRA and maybe get her into some index funds? I'm worried she's going to have to work until she's 80 at this rate. Any suggestions would be awesome.

We're in a good spot financially in that the only debt we have is our mortgage and the income is comfortable enough that we don't really blink or panic at an expensive car repair or home improvement project and pay those off pretty much out of our own pockets.

We want to minimize the hassle of investing for now and just start generating some income, so we've ruled out a financial advisor (and we don't really have the time for that with a very busy family life). That leaves us with robo advisors which seems to occupy a nice middle ground.

We almost started with Fidelity Go only because we both have our retirement funds in there, but then I thought there must be a bunch of options to choose from. I wasn't wrong, there's more robo advisors out there than you can shake a stick at.

***My question to you all is what criteria should we use in selecting the best robo advisor for us?***

I've already figured in tax-loss harvesting which sounds like a very wise thing to have to mitigate losses due to taxes. I've also read about direct indexing which I understand is more limiting with robo advisors, but is it worth finding on that offers that? Is there a benefit to putting in X amount of money in a particular stock or is that overrated? I feel like that kind of thing is a little more lucky than strategic, or am I wrong? What other criteria might I be missing or neglecting that's important? Fees seems to be a little irrelevant as they appear to be more or less similar across the board (but please point out if I'm wrong in this thinking!).

In my company, I am authorized to work as him, I can execute trades under his direction, but cannot confirm trades.

When I started working for him and learned the investment system he tasked me with a project to switch about 50 clients from Brokerage A-Shares to Advisory C Shares. He explained to me that they have lower fees and it’s in their best interest to do so. He called each one and like a script said “remember when I told you that once you hit the 5k threshold we can switch you to advisory for lower fees which is in your best interest?” They all just went along and said okay, they trusted him.

I began submitting them and was directed to use the same rationale for each one by saying:

“Client was not interested in paying the advisory fee - now that they have a new employer they are comfortable with the ongoing fee. Although they are aware of the expenses associated with selling out of A shares, the benefit of having an actively managed account outweighs that cost.”

This was false, none of them got new jobs. I raised suspicions when some were being approved and some coming back with clarification needed. They would all ask the same thing. What has changed for the client that the switch from A to C is in their best interest? If the eventual plan was C shares, why was that not recommended? Some are still pending because nothing he could provide would work. I had a meeting with our investment headquarters and they told me this is borderline churning and that rationales need to differ and be specific to the client. They told me that A shares are meant to be held and this is Mutual fund switching.

Over the last 1 year I've invested around 4k into VOO and 2k in ETH and BTC. I usually save around $500 a month to invest, this is after having 20k saved up in a HYSA. 

Last month I invest 1k into various yieldmax stocks. They're all high dividend stocks that have been paying 80-90% distributions for the past couple of years. The monthly distribution return from them was as expected and I reinvested the dividend back. My plan is to increase this dividend portfolio to around 5k, while keeping my VOO contributions going on.

Looking at the trend and my saving/investment capacity, I feel like in a year I'll be able to reach 5k and that would mean around 350-400 a month in dividend yield. That is when I plan on diverting this into my VOO contribution, effectively doubling the current pace. I am aware of the tax implications of dividends and I feel like since my dividend yield is so low compared to bigger investors, I can easily absorb it.

I know the stock market is not without risks, NAV erosion can occur, but the underlying stocks in these dividend ETFs are all performing well and I feel will continue to do so, hence I don't really see any pitfalls in this strategy considering this is going to be at most a 3-4 year plan.

It has to do with bond market positioning. The more ""bullish"" bonds become the more strain it puts on the market and because the economy is running on fumes and surviving by ""wealth effect"" that's why bond market rallies look like they happen because of recessions.

It's really the other way around.

In 2007, the bond market began to rally around July/August in anticipation of the first rate cut which was September 2007. The market made an ATH in July/August and then one more in December 2007.

That was the end for the next 6 years. The Market wouldn't see that ATH again until 2013.

The key points are that this post isn't because of a market dip today, I been saying I was short for weeks now.

The point is that the bond market will drive a severe recession as it is a giant ocean of money.

You think the S&P 500 composite represents a large market cap? It's a pond compared to the bond market.

When the bond market becomes bullish, it'll drain so much money out of the S&P that it will make all you perma-bulls look like perma-foo0Is.

And this is a problem that's decently well understood, so it's traded, and you're seeing that pattern play out tit-for-tat. Go overlay the current bull-rally pattern over the 2007 pattern and you'll see it's fairly similar.

It's because the bond market is getting ready to move. And when money flows into it, the rest of the entire economy will starve, unemployment goes up, foreclosures go up, repos go up, and no one will have spare money to buy stocks.",2025-08-01,-0.7717,Negative,"['ATH', 'ATH']"

A simple value investing strategy for the retail investor : Diversified portfolio with chances to beat the market,1mez5mo,West_Application_760,2025-08-01 15:14:40,0,0.5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mez5mo/a_simple_value_investing_strategy_for_the_retail/,"After losing money with trading, bad decisions and temperamental buy or sell given by Twitter influencers, blind recommendations, leaverage and other errors, I decided some months ago to begin to use only value investing. Value investing was the reason why I originally began to invest but in the first 1.5 years I took bad decisions.

My strategy is based on the following books :

1. One up on wall street 
2. The little book that beats the market 
3. Acquirer’s Multiple 
4. Warren buffet accounting book( don't remember the exact name) 
I also implement other tips and suggestions made in reddit and scientific articles. The strategy doesn't aim to be the best but to have peace of mind, be simple to implement with good potential researched and story backed to beat the market. 




1.Screener :

The first step for a retail investor to invest without much time is to get a list of the best 100 stocks. There are many ways to do this. Based on my readings and research there are different screener thst can give stocks that can beat the market. They are all implemented with tradingview 

1.1 Magic formula: In this one we want to have a low EV/EBIT but with high ROIC. Instead of the classical ranking, for an easy and practical implementation, I just insert good values thst give me 100 stocks. Roic is over 30% and ev/EBIT is under 8. 

1.2 Acquirer’s Multiple : In this one we only use ev/EBIT but I also add some small weight on roic. This is a magic formula essentially with heavier weight on the ev/EBIT. Roic here is over 8% while ev/ebit is under 3

1.3 Conservative formula : Here we screen based on momentum first, given by stocks that increased price over 15% last 12 months. Then we also want to have low volatility. Instead of using 3 year volatility, here I use a beta of 3 years lower than 0.9 and a 1M volatility lower than 3%. The last step is to add high payout yield. Here I prefer buyback than dividend with over 3% buyback and over 1% dividend. You can change this but minimum yield should be 4% Always

1.4 Motley fool value and growth : Here we use a combination of factors that I can tell more in detail later as it's long. The idea is to combine Peg under 1 (favourite Lynch indicator) with growth indicators. The growth indicators are mainly high Eps, low inventories, low debt and others. This is close to Lynch strategy with some more weight to growth and it has worked very well recently. 

1.5 A custom portfolio : Based on the recent ones and lynch recommendations I made a portfolio that balance all the previous recommendations (without the Motley) to give 100 stocks best. However this is balanced but can be flawed in some aspects. 


2. A good strategy to select stocks to buy :

After you screen 100 stocks (or 500 stocks with all screeners together) using all markets you want. In my case usa, Europe and Asia. The next thing is to choose what stock you buy. For this I developed a check list (following Charlie munger recommendations). The checklist will have several categories : Financial health, relative valuation, DCF and quantitative measurements. To buy a stock, it must pass with 0 points or more each category. To each individual subcategory we will give points - 1, 0 or 1. 

2.1 Financial health: A company must be financially healthy. The first step is to get over 0 points here. There are 2 things we will use. Low debt /equity and high F-score. If you want you can use debt /assets. 

2.2 Relative valuation: This is the biggest category and the one I like the most. We are retail so we need something simple, a number we can look at. Here we want high roic, high fcf yield, low ev/ebit, low peg, roic over average of industry, good pe vs historial average, good lynch fair value, high net and gross margins, margins better than industry average, higher eps revisions compared to analysts in last quarters. 

2.3 DCF: discounted cash flow is hard and main reason why we do formula investing. If we would know how to do it well and understand the business we wouldn't need all this. However we can do a simple trick. We make 3 scenarios and we pick growth fcf last year, last 3, last 5, last 10 and last 20. Bear case : Will be the lowest of the previous and if the industry is growing much slower, you could even average both number. Base case :last 20 or 10 year growth or more recent if it went up lastly, maybe 5 year or 3 is good. Never pick 1 year last. Here you can also average with industry cage. For bull case you just pick highest interval without average. For terminal growth you use 5-10%. You determine this with gut feeling, the one that looks more likely. We give a point if we have 10% or more margin respect current price with discount rate of 10%. - 1 if it's lower. Like this for each category. If both normal and bear give that stock is overpriced, we don't buy

2.4 : Qualitative, understand the business : As I said we don't want to spend much time but we can spend some to see this : Founders still in the company if company is young, otherwise give 0 points. Second we want that insiders are buying and insiders have 10% or more of shares. We want margins and eps stable over time, indication of a good moat.

Final considerations :
 After picking a stock and doing all this, if goes well you can buy. You want a porfolio with 15-30 stocks and revisions each quarter to see if each still pass all the metrics, otherwise sell. The qualitative metric is very short and weak so that one can be ignored if all others look good. But this is just my opinion, you need to assess. Also 1 year beta of portfolio must be always between 0.5 and 1.5. This is to ensure you don't have too much volatility but also you have good gains since even conservative formula has an average of 0.7 beta. Anothe is that stocks can't be ever lower than 50M market cap. The upper limit isn't set. Some books recommend less than 1B for retail investors but honestly I have seen amazing opportunities with more. I suggest diversified portfolio between countries, companh sizes and sectors. Also you can use this strategy with 70-80% portfolio and still use the rest for your personal bets like bitcoin, gold, silver, bonds, housing... 


Now why do I tell all this? If you reach this point I only want you tell me your honest opinion of this strategy, tips, recommendations or even suggest books. Thanks ",2025-08-01,0.9989,Positive,"['EV', 'EBIT', 'ROIC', 'EBIT', 'EBIT', 'EBIT', 'DCF', 'DCF']"

The consumers, it seemed, brought up the devices, earlier than otherwise, to beat the tariffs and price hikes that might come associated with it.  The company said the tariffs cost them about $800 mn and in the upcoming quarter it could be in the range of $1.1 bn (\~40% more).

So, with more tariffs coming in today (assuming atleast some stick longer), it either is going to eat into the company’s margin or more unlikely but passed onto the consumers, there is a good expectation that this will cause sales to go down.  With most customers having already bought the iPhones last quarter to beat the tariffs, the sales from the upcoming quarter have been cannibalized in the previous quarter.  The wearables and ipad sales are already down, even after launching a cheaper ipad.

I wanted to discuss the 37% tank after $ALGN earnings today. They have 80-90% of the clear  aligner market share and posted revenue of 1.01B (est. 1.06B) and EPS of 2.49 (est. 2.57), giving murky guidance suggesting the macro environment is causing people to tighten up and opt out of optional ortho treatments. The opposite happened during Covid and they shot up to $700 per share on huge demand in that market. This is now a 4B annual revenue company with a 9B market cap with 1.1B in free cash and no significant debt, they also announced a 150M-170M budget for “restructuring” to improve margins which are currently 69% gross (they just make software and mold plastic). Is this not an unbelievable value buy at  this price? What am I missing here.

I don't believe diversifying into different companies, is as important as the actual sector or asset class.

For example, US stock market was down bad in first 2 quarters because of tariffs, but gold was doing well. Had you sold off all your stocks when the market was on a downward trend, you would have dry powder to rotate your money to where capital is flowing, which was gold.  

Right now, AI and Tech has momentum again and in my opinion, it's better to hold NVDA instead of VOO since VOO lumps in low performers to help you ""diversify"".

What’s being missed:

AMD is gaining quiet traction from Nvidia in segments that care about control and efficiency - specifically open-source AI deployments. That preference isn’t ideological, it’s architectural.

The core demand is coming from three categories:

	1.	Sovereign buyers (EU, Middle East) who won’t bet their AI stack on a black-box vendor.

	2.	Hyperscalers (MSFT, META, Oracle) selectively onboarding AMD into their model training workflows to reduce vendor lock-in.

	3.	Startups and smaller firms where unit economics matter, and AMD’s open-source orientation offers clear flexibility advantages.

The idea that Nvidia has a permanent hardware monopoly is a form of mental laziness. AMD doesn’t need to “beat” Nvidia - it only needs to absorb the non-Nvidia demand that’s scaling underneath the narrative.

The market is large. The shift is already happening.

Factoring in inflation when calculating long term rates of return,1meeetd,theRak27,2025-07-31 21:42:32,5,0.86,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1meeetd/factoring_in_inflation_when_calculating_long_term/,"If I want to calculate a reasonable rate of return for my investments I tend to be very conservative, but, as im sure many of you also do, i still want to look at roughly how much money i could end up with after 20 or 30 years of being on this investing path.

So when I use a compound interest calculator, I've noticed one thing that i find interesting, and because of my lack of proper math expertise, i wanted to ask you guys and girls about it. Maybe it will clear things up for folks that have had the same doubt. 

If I understand correctly, when i count on a 7% yearly nominal rate of return, and expect a 3% average yearly inflation, this would be equivalent to a 4% real yearly return on my investment. (That's conservative, I'm well aware but it's just an example, the actual numbers are irrelevant)

However this formula doesn't take into account that when i'm Dollar Cost Averaging, the value of my monthly or bi-weekly investments is going to be worth less and less as years go by, so if I invest 500 dollars a month now, by the time 25 years have passed, investing 500 dollars a month will have a much lower real value than today. 

So my question is: 

- Am I wrong? Simply taking nominal returns and adjusting them for inflation seem to forget that the real value of my monthly payments is also continually decreasing. 

- If so, are the compound interest calculators useless? Even when they explicitly ask you for an estimated yearly inflation, they don't seem to take into account the decreasing value of your DCA investments, so they end up greatly overestimating the actual real value of accumulated investments by a lot. 


I find this notion arrogant on my behalf and I assume im making a math mistake, as i doubt institutions like Financial Times or the US Gov wouldn't take this into account in their compound interest calculators. But I've been looking it up and im growingly confused about it. 

I guess that if I was right, the answer would be to continually adjust my monthly payments to match inflation? So 500 dollars on year one, 510 en year 2, etc...   


I hope i made my doubts clear.

If you have any money in the market that you are not willing to lose, now is the time to pull it imo. If you have any money that you are willing to place into high risk bets, put them.

Tarriff day tomorrow prices, at ATH and new darlings beingnul 3-10x YTD on speculation, and earnings reports due.

This has been the wildest but most predictable set of three weeks I have seen in five years.

Is rollover IRA with Vanguard actually considered a Traditional IRA even though I rollovered from a Roth 401k?,1meau7r,crusading_angel,2025-07-31 19:23:26,1,0.67,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1meau7r/is_rollover_ira_with_vanguard_actually_considered/,"So essentially I left my company about 2 years ago with 26k that I contributed all through a roth 401k. 

I did a rollover 2 years ago and I was sent a 26k check which I deposited into Vanguard. I was doing research on a backdoor roth and it just hit me that this might actually be classified as a traditional IRA even though I used funds from my roth 401k. 

  
I did get a 5498 form from Vanguard. The only numbers listed in the form is in line 2 for (rollover contributions) and line 5 (fair market value of account). 

  
This is the info on the bottom of the form for line 2: Line 2. Shows any rollover, including a direct rollover to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, or a qualified rollover contribution (including a military death gratuity or SGLI payment) to a Roth IRA you made in 2023. It does not show any amounts you converted from your traditional IRA, SEP IRA, or SIMPLE IRA to a Roth IRA. They are shown in line 3. It does not show any late rollover contributions. They are shown in line 13a. See the Form 1040 or 1040-SR instructions for information on how to report rollovers. If you have ever made any nondeductible contributions to your traditional IRA or SEP IRA and you did not roll over the total distribution, use Form 8606 to figure the taxable amount. If property was rolled over, see Pub. 590-A. For a qualified rollover to a Roth IRA, also see Pub. 590-A.

  
For line 5: Shows the FMV of all investments in your account at year end. However, if a decedent’s name is shown, the amount reported may be the FMV on the date of death. If the FMV shown is zero for a decedent, the executor or administrator of the estate may request a date-of-death value from the financial institution.

Not quite the same as DCA'ing into longs where, for me at least, I just have target portfolio allocations and add in bulk when able or when the price looks right.

But, today SPY looks like it's just weakening before August and will retest the 100 day moving average which is below 200 day moving average. Price ALWAYS retests 100day moving average if it crosses above 200day.

So this type of trade is now seeming high probability.

I use call-credit spreads to make synthetic shorts. This way I can control break-even cost basis. I'm keeping my cost basis a nice healthy \~3-5% higher than the current price.

So far this has been generating more and more money lately so it fits the ""if it's working add to it"" maxim of short trading.

I can remain ""mid-to-long term bullish"" but still keep a short-term bearish outlook because of that fact that price always retests the 100day crossing above 200day area.

But, in actuality unless the market has a healthy pullback and soon, I'm extremely long-term bearish because rate cuts will hit the market like a ton of bricks, flood the housing market with supply, dump prices all across the board and reveal just how weak the economy really is as equity in many asset classes goes into the toilet.

Max drawdowns including the 2 massive bear markets (dotcom bubble and 2008 GFC) are similar to 100% VOO.

Any holes in this strategy involving TQQQ and leveraged gold? Keep in mind this already factors in the common misconception that volatility decay eats into your capital. It’s canceled out by exponential compounding gains during bull runs and exponential compounding losses during bear markets (which prevent your capital going to zero or negative unlike margin).

Could tariffs be good for Amazon?,1mdsoia,wballz,2025-07-31 04:58:33,0,0.2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mdsoia/could_tariffs_be_good_for_amazon/,"So in the lead up to earnings there has been a lot of talk about what to expect. Seems to me the two main themes have been:

- AWS should continue with huge growth, as we’ve seen from Google and msft’s earnings reports with their cloud sectors reporting 32% and 34% YoY rev increases.

- Tariffs will have hit the retail side of the business and could mean figures come under expectations.

Now it’s this second point I am wondering about. I understand much of Amazon sales would be hit with tariffs but I would have thought that the tariffs also meant that users of Temu, Shein, AliExpress have all moved back to Amazon and are now hoping to avoid tariffs (at least on some purchases) via Amazon.

Ran 5-year investment analysis vs $1.2M Bay Area home purchase - Is it better to walk away and keep renting?,1mdc5yr,ultron2450,2025-07-30 17:04:50,29,0.75,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mdc5yr/ran_5year_investment_analysis_vs_12m_bay_area/,"We're considering walking away from a $1.2M townhome purchase in the East Bay and want to validate our thinking before making this final decision.

# Our Financial Situation

* Household income: \~$360k base with annual bonuses (adds 12-18% yearly)
* Down payment ready: $400k
* Current rent: $3k/month for 2br/2ba with rent control protections
* Market rate for similar rentals: $2800 -4,200+ in our area

# The Property Details

The townhome is in Dublin and is in a newer development near good schools, but comes with some high costs:

* Mello Ross: \~$500+ monthly for 25+ years (until around 2050)
* HOA fees: $440/month
* Property taxes: Standard rate but on $1.2M assessment
* Financing: Looking at 6.875% rates in current market or 5.875 for 5 year ARM

# Our Analysis

When we calculated total monthly ownership costs versus our current situation, we would be paying approximately $4,500 MORE per month than we do now. This includes mortgage, taxes, special assessments, HOA, insurance.

Here's where it gets interesting: We ran a 5-year scenario assuming the house appreciates at 7% annually (aggressive but possible in this market). Even with that appreciation, investing our $400k down payment plus the $4,500 monthly difference in index funds would give us nearly $1M in investable assets after 5 years.

This means we could potentially put down 60%+ on a $1.68M house (what this one would cost in 5 years) versus 33% today. So basically, we would move from barely affording the down payment to having enough to buy most of the house outright.

# Why We're Hesitating

The math seems almost too good to be true, which makes us wonder if we're missing something important. The Mello Roos special assessments really hurt the economics - that's $500+ monthly (2% increase every year) that provides no return and continues for decades.

# Our Questions

1. Are we being too conservative by assuming we can consistently invest the monthly difference?
2. Is there a flaw in comparing liquid investments to real estate ownership benefits?
3. Are we underestimating the non-financial benefits of homeownership?
4. Could we be missing tax advantages or other factors that change the calculation?
5. Is the ""priced out forever"" fear legitimate, or does the math actually work in our favor?

We genuinely liked this property and the location, but the numbers made us step back. The special assessments(Mello Roos) alone would cost us \~$180k+ over 25 years - money that could compound significantly if invested instead.

Has anyone else done similar analysis when facing Bay Area purchase decisions? Are we overthinking this, or does the investment approach make sense given current market conditions?

**TL;DR**: Running numbers on $1.2M Bay Area townhome vs continuing to rent + invest. Math suggests waiting 5 years while investing creates much stronger financial position even with home appreciation.

"VKTX – Short Interest Sky High, Fundamentals Even Higher",1n6mudi,Remarkable-Ad5326,2025-09-02 15:37:45,44,0.88,36,https://i.redd.it/9x4s7ab1urmf1.jpeg,"I think I've found one of the most mispriced stocks right now in the market - VKTX. This is a 3bn pharma company. Their lotto ticket is the oral weight loss pill VK2735. 

1. High short interest 

The short interest is 27% and days to cover is entire week. This is like lighting a fire near a barrel of gas. If WSB really gets a hold of this stock as it has some of the other names in the past, it will become one that we look back on. 

2. Superior oral weight loss drug

It took 13 weeks for VK2735 to produce the same results as what took for Eli Lilly's drug Orfoglipron to do in 70ish weeks. That's insane when you think about it. Lilly's trial was a phase 3, whereas VKTX's was a phase 2 trial. VKTX will be moving to phase 3 next and they'll showcase even further weight loss with a full trial.

We don't have data (not released) from LLY of what the weight loss % was for their drug at 13 weeks. I suspect they wouldn't want to share that anyway - it wouldnt help them, and might only hurt them. Just putting that out there so that we are doing apples to apples comparisons. 


3. Massively underestimated and underrated

Eli Lilly today gained 30bn market cap after announcing they will proceed to seek approval for orfoglipron. That is 10x the market cap of VKTX. That's if VKTX announced they are ready to seek approval of their drug, they would shoot up from $25 to $250 per share price. 

Many top analysts have them at $80-120 price target. Raymond James, Jeffries, Oppenheimer all have $120+ price targets with BUY ratings. Morgan Stanley has them at $102. 

4. Side effects misunderstood / overreaction 

The reason they dropped recently is because there was a high rate of drop outs in the phase 2 trial. However, if you remember, this was a 13 week trial with fast titration. As a pharmacist, this class of medication is notorious for nausea if not titrated slowly. Their next phase of trial they will adjust these parameters and do a longer study. 

5. Buyout target

There are companies out there who want a piece of the pie of weight loss drugs because we are starting to realize that weight loss solves a whole host of other problems - liver, kidney, cardiovascular, and so on. Every day there is a new study published on these drugs that makes LLY jump or NVO jump. 

VKTX is considered one of the top buyout targets at the moment in the pharma space. They can easily clear a share price of $100 at least if announced a buyout. 

Top analysts from JP Morgan and Goldman sachs and others project the glp market to be a 50-100billion market by 2030. Even a third player to LLY and NVO can enjoy a big share of the pie without even having to outcompete them. 

6. With vktx oral pill, you can potentially achieve a rapid weight loss on the high doses and then switch to a lower maintenance dose, without even requiring injections. You can't do that with the competitor pills.

I would probably go shares for this play. It has the potential for a 5x within the next year. I bought calls myself gambling on a buyout.

The point is this stock took an absolute prison beating after its Q2 earnings because of slightly lower than expected Q3 guidance. Despite the fact they raised full year guidance and had +27% year over year revenue growth, the stock still took a 30% haricut.

I don't believe in technical analysis or colorful lines but since the drop, the stock has been bouncing off resistance at $180 until it broke through on Thursday. On Friday it continued up while the rest of the market and tech sector sold off. Nothing about the core business has changed and I believe the selloff was bigly overdone, so over the course of the next month or two we'll see a move back to the $270 range. Two upcoming catalysts will likely help with that, MNDY speaks at the Goldman Sachs conference Sep 10th, and they're hosting the 2025 Elevate conference in NYC on Sep 17th-18th. Goldman Sachs maintains a BUY rating and $270 PT on the stock, and I expect we'll get more information about the AI hyped digital workers and product powerups the company has been teasing during Elevate.

Also Congressman Bresnahan, the guy who said he'd ban trading in congress, bought MNDY twice this year alongside his other tech purchases NVDA and SNOW.

"Nvidia’s top 2 mystery customers made 39% of Q2 revenue, up from 25% last year, raising concentration risk concerns",1n4wvy8,callsonreddit,2025-08-31 14:58:16,1600,0.96,260,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n4wvy8/nvidias_top_2_mystery_customers_made_39_of_q2/,"No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nvidias-top-two-mystery-customers-made-up-39percent-of-its-q2-revenue-.html)

Two Nvidia customers made up 39% of Nvidia’s revenue in its July quarter, the company revealed in a financial filing on Wednesday, raising concerns about the concentration of the chipmaker’s clientele.

“Customer A” made up 23% of total revenue, and “Customer B” comprised 16% of total revenue, according to the company’s second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

That’s higher than the same quarter a year ago when Nvidia’s top two customers made up 14% and 11% of sales, according to the filing.

The company regularly publishes information on a quarterly basis about its top customers, but the disclosure this week is fueling a renewed debate about whether Nvidia’s explosive growth is being driven by a handful of large cloud providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle.

Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said in a Wednesday statement that “large cloud service providers” made up about 50% of the company’s data center revenue. That’s important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia’s overall revenue in the second quarter.

“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia wrote in the filing.

Increasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia.

“We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 \[cloud service provider\] capex expectations,” wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock.

But Nvidia’s Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It’s a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.

In its filing, Nvidia says it has both “direct customers” and “indirect customers.” Customer A and Customer B are listed as “direct customers.”

Direct customers are not the end users of Nvidia’s chips. They’re companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.

Indirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia’s direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.

Deciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia’s mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.

Additionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.

Contributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an “AI research and development company” contributed a “meaningful” amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.

Nvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company’s AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and “neoclouds,” which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for “sovereign AI.” All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia’s revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.

Huang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend — $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.

“As you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,” Huang said.",2025-08-31,0.9863,Positive,"['HSBC', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'CEO', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI']"

“$HE -the boring monopoly in the middle of the ocean that’s about to not be so boring”,1n4dcsn,BraveTrades420,2025-08-30 21:39:16,349,0.9,134,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n4dcsn,"Alright you smooth brained degenerates, let me give you the pitch. I’ve been trading $HE (Hawaiian Electric) almost exclusively for the last couple years. It’s not sexy like NVDA, but it’s been my favorite slot machine for collecting premiums writing puts/calls while slowly stacking shares.

Yes, this is the same company whose market cap got slaughtered when people thought they were about to get sued into oblivion over the Maui fires. That litigation has since been settled. It’s literally a monopoly utility in the middle of the ocean. People can’t exactly shop around for electricity out there. I like the stock.

For the past year, it’s been sideways chop city. Nice and flat, easy for me to milk option premiums. But here’s the thing: something is changing.
	•	Since last earnings, volume has been creeping up steadily.
	•	The stock has quietly been making higher highs + higher lows (classic bullish setup).
	•	Call volume is juicy across all strikes – even way OTM covered calls are getting eaten alive.
	•	Premiums are waking up but still cheap compared to the move that feels like it’s brewing.
	•	Chart is sitting at strong support and looks primed for a run.

I stopped writing covered calls and loaded calls instead. Maybe it’s insiders. Maybe it’s just the natural cycle after a year of consolidation. But the tape looks fishy in a bullish way.

Where could it go? $15 looks like a given, $18 feels likely, and dare I say $20 isn’t out of the question if this thing really rips. I’m not here to sell you hopium, just pointing out that the stock is waking up after hibernating. 

I’m long, I’m loaded, and I’m posting this because I know you degenerates like a clean setup with asymmetric risk/reward.

Not financial advice, but if you want a utility stonk with a little spice, $HE might be it.",2025-08-30,0.991,Positive,"['HE', 'NVDA', 'OTM', 'HE']"

"Google cut 35% of small-team managers over past year, offers buyouts in 10 product areas",1n43n2j,callsonreddit,2025-08-30 14:54:27,946,0.97,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n43n2j/google_cut_35_of_smallteam_managers_over_past/,"No paywall: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/google-executive-says-company-has-cut-a-third-of-its-managers.html)

Google has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization.

“Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports” than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. “So a lot of fast progress there.”

At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, “internal barriers” and Google’s culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.

Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently.

“When we look across our entire leadership population, that’s managers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time,” he said.

The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company “to be more efficient as we scale up so we don’t solve everything with headcount.”

Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts “a little further.” Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.

Regarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented “Voluntary Exit Program” offers. They’ve applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year. 

Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, said at last week’s meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts.

“This has been actually quite successful,” she said, adding “I think we can continue it.”

Pichai said the company executed the voluntary buyouts after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs.

“It’s a lot of work that’s gone into implementing the VEP program, and I’m glad we’ve done it,” Pichai said. “It gives people agency, and I’m glad to see it’s worked out well.”

‘Wanting a career break’

Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work.

“It’s actually quite interesting to see who’s taking a VEP, and it’s people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members,” she said.

CNBC previously reported that the layoffs hurt morale as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet’s shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.

At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to Meta’s “recharge,” a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company.

“We have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that — resting and recharging,” said Alexandra Maddison, Google’s senior director of benefits.

She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical.

“We’re very confident that our current offering is competitive,” Maddison said.

Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies’ benefits.

“I don’t think they have a VEP at Meta by the way,” Cicconi said.

Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, “Should we incorporate all policies of Meta while we’re at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?”

“Maybe I should try running the company with all of Meta’s policies,” he continued. “No, probably not.”",2025-08-30,0.9869,Positive,"['CNBC', 'CEO', 'VEP', 'VEP', 'CNBC', 'VEP']"

Gilead (based in Foster City, CA) is close to Kyverna’s headquarters in Emeryville, CA (~30 miles)

Everyone: I'm going to give you my opinion based on information I have obtained from the internet. I am not an insider, just an average Joe. KYTX is going to get bought out by Gilead Sciences. Once again, just my opinion. Gilead is just a short drive to KYTX, about 30 miles, maybe leading to cost cuts. Gilead along with Vida Ventures owns about 20% of KYTX. Vida Ventures has been involved with Gilead before helping Gilead buy another company and the Gilead board has some Vida Venture people on it. I believe both companies own KYTX at a much higher price than KYTX currently trades at. Novo Holdings owns about 5% of KYTX. Novo could make a play for KYTX but it would not go through. Insiders hold a nice amount of stock. Bain Capital is associated with Mitt Romney. I believe but not 100% sure that Bain Capital likes to sell companies and not run them. There is one other institutional holder that likes to sell companies also. Gilead has a good history of buying companies and this could add about 2% in value to Gilead (obviously KYTX has to hit on it's new drugs). The problem may be that KYTX may only be worth $15.00. Other insiders own KYTX higher so they are not going to happy. I own a lot at around $3.35.

Options. The answer is always options. /yes, this is a joke  


(my last post got removed, ig for not being enough of a meme? or maybe my options joke? well, now it's full effort time, with emoji reactions and making sure I fully identify jokes... hey, I'll even throw in educational backstory)

educational backstory: year to date losses were from call options in $SOFI. Those would have fully recovered, if you take a look at YTD performance. I'd been doing quite well with $SOFI in my 401(k), but of course, the moment I liquidated my ever-rolling $SOFI calls in Robinhood (to evaluate my next move), that's when $SOFI mooned, and I figured it was a dead cat bounce, so I missed out. So I've since returned to an old favorite, which is what is driving the portfolio value difference between each screenshot taken within minutes of each other–lots of $VFC call options that have been on a tear lately (I'm sorry–I like en dashes, I'm not AI).

Now for that All-Time loss story. A bit of that was from learning options, but most of those losses, iirc, were from early stage healthcare stocks, a movie ticket service, and a major, now infamous, Indian streaming company that had some loyal followers on forums. I abandoned my $TSLA call options just before it went onto massive gains years ago, and went all in on the streamer.  Actually did seem legit from my DD, because they were merging with a notable American studio that had produced some solid blockbusters. But hey, guess what? Months after that merger went through, the American studio, iirc, sued the streaming platform and they separated. The rest is history. Also tried out a healthcare company with a solid product portfolio and management that had good results on previous ventures. Like a lot of early medical companies seem to though, they used the stock like a piggybank and kept issuing more and more shares. It didn't matter how well trials were doing or what cleared the FDA, because any gain would be suppressed by another issuance and a fair bit of M&A and management bonuses that were funded by shares.

I don't know what it is though. When I'm self-managing my 401(k), I'm very responsible and have solid, market-beating gains. When I open up Robinhood, it's like I need to rep my WSB cred and yolo on some hair-brained idea.

So now I'm on my redemption arc of trying to treat my Robinhood account a bit more like my 401(k).",2025-08-29,0.9948,Positive,"['MOOOO', 'SOFI', 'YTD', 'SOFI', 'SOFI', 'SOFI', 'VFC', 'AI', 'TSLA', 'DD', 'FDA', 'WSB']"

To keep this brief, I will simply list all the **catalysts** on the horizon.

# Trump’s executive order: Unleashing American Drone Dominance

On June 6, 2025, Trump signed this [**executive order**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/unleashing-american-drone-dominance/), and if many people are still wondering what **drones** have to do with Archer Aviation, it is because almost no one has reviewed **Section 6**.

The summary of this section is to establish a **pilot program to safely accelerate the integration of eVTOL aircraft into US airspace**.

* Around **September 4, 2025**, the deadline for the Secretary of Transportation to **propose at least five eVTOL pilot projects** will end.
* The **final selection** of these projects will take place approximately during the **first days of December**.

That said, Archer is a strong candidate, and seeing several photos of Adam Goldstein (the CEO) [**inside**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/comments/1kskoew/adam_at_the_white_house/) the **White House** only reinforces my **bullish outlook**.

# Participation in events

I am sharing the updated **calendar** that I mentioned earlier in another post on [r/ACHR](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/).

* **September 3, 2025**: [Needham Transportation Technology Industry Leaders 1x1 Conference](https://investors.archer.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2025/Needham-Transportation-Technology-Industry-Leaders-1x1-Conference-2025-_AuMrQMIwy/default.aspx)
* **September 4, 2025**: [DB’s 15th Annual Aviation Forum: Airlines, Lessors, Manufacturers](https://investors.archer.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2025/DBs-15th-Annual-Aviation-Forum-Airlines-Lessors-Manufacturers-2025-4pygbzHK-0/default.aspx).
* **November 17 to 21:** the **Dubai AirShow** will be held between these dates.

This last event is important because **Adam Goldstein** confirmed in an [**article**](https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/companies-news/dubai-airshow-2025-launches-future-facing-conference-programme-to-drive-global-aerospace-innovation-nivkoppe) published on **August 5, 2025**, that they expect to **fly the Midnight during the event**, and the real question here is whether they will perform a **conventional flight or a vertical takeoff and landing**.

# News with Anduril… probably soon

The management team’s contact with the White House does not seem coincidental to me, given that Archer has stated on numerous occasions that it is working with **Anduril** on the manufacture of an eVTOL for military use.

The problem here is obvious: Adam wants to announce the work the company is involved in at the **military level**, but with the **White House** involved, the issue is **confidential**, and I gather that is why he has not yet been able to reveal anything about it.

And it seems that the relationship with **Anduril** is going from strength to strength, because a couple of weeks ago they were looking to [**hire**](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4704976007?gh_jid=4704976007&gh_src=) an “**Experimental Test Pilot — VTOL**” that could be related to Archer Aviation’s military aircraft.

In February 2025, Archer [**registered**](https://uspto.report/company/Archer-Aviation-Inc) 3 new trademarks (Monarch, Giraffa and Mothra), indicating that they are **aircraft**, and I believe that these are the ones that could be related to the **military side** of the company, as well as Palantir and Anduril.

Oh, and of course, we can’t forget **Palantir**: ask yourself what you know about Palantir and **what the US government wants you to know** about Palantir, and then remember that it was recently trading at around $190.

In fact, two recent acquisitions are worth highlighting here: the [**Reddit community**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACHR/comments/1mk53ns/a_little_earnings_surprise_nobody_is_talking_about/) has already noted that the **acquisition of Overair** could be highly strategic, as the company generates several million dollars in **revenue** per year, **positioning Archer Aviation as the highest revenue EVTOL company**.

Furthermore, the **acquisition on Susan St**. is also strategic, because **Anduril’s offices are literally a few steps away**, which leads me to believe that the military aircraft is in an advanced state.

I can also mention **the anticipated start of operations in Abu Dhabi at the end of 2025** as another **catalyst**, in addition to the **sale of some of the aircraft when they are ready**.

For me, **this stock is no longer speculative**; **it is more a question of “when” rather than “if.”**

"Ormat technologies (ORA) has the macro, the micro, and the management to scale rapidly.",1n38mja,pandadogunited,2025-08-29 14:15:34,13,0.72,14,https://i.redd.it/norqdf9qvylf1.jpeg,"Ormat Technologies (ORA) has the macro, the micro, and the management to grow rapidly.

Ormat is a geothermal company that does everything in house.  They find geothermal deposits, build the power plants using equipment they built themselves, and then operate the power plants.  As of writing, they have around 2 gigawatts of production spread across the globe, only 10% of which is in the US.  That number is going to get a whole hell of a lot larger.  I'm sure you can guess at least part of the reason why.

It's AI. AI requires power, geothermal is baseload power that isn't vulnerable to fuel price fluctuations, yadda yadda, you heard this 50 gorillian times before.  What you probably haven't heard is the tax incentives.  The big beautiful bill extended the tax credit for geothermal power out to 2032 and reinstated 100% bonus depreciation.  Combined, any geothermal plant built before 2032 will get 50% of the capex back in tax incentives.  Then, once the plant is operational, they can deduct 15% of their net income because of percentage depletion (another tax thing).  That's great an all, but that doesn't solve geothermal's fundamental problem with scaling.  Geothermal plants can only be built in certain areas, and all the money in the world won't change that.  Well, that's where enhanced geothermal energy comes in.  Enhanced geothermal energy is pretty much the geothermal equivalent of fracking, and allows for geothermal plants to be built almost anywhere.  The tech for that is still new, but enhanced geothermal plants have been built and run successfully, allowing geothermal to scale beyond it's previous constraints.

So why geothermal instead of nuclear?  Firstly, they aren't mutually exclusive, but there are some reasons to choose geothermal.  It isn't reliant on uranium prices, which as all the regards in UUUU should know are prone to wild fluctuations.  A fuel source that can go from 20 dollars a pound to 100 dollars a pound in 7 years obviously isn't great when trying to determine how feasible a project is.  Then, there's the construction time.  Geothermal plants take about 2 years to build and, after some fresh legislation, take about a month or two.  Nuclear plants take about twice the time to build, and roughly the same amount of time to permit.  Then there's the stigma of nuclear, which geothermal doesn't really have.  For AI companies scrambling to grow as fast as possible those 2 years and no worry of NIMBYism will make a large difference.  

So that's geothermal as a whole, but why Ormat in particular?  Ormat is one of if not the largest geothermal companies, with 50 years of experience and around 1.5 gigawatts of power production spread across six continents and 30 countries. They are completely vertically integrated, prospecting, building, and operating their plants using equipment they built themselves.  That last part is particularly important, as Ormat also sells their equipment to other geothermal companies, and stand to benefit from the tariffs making Chinese drilling equipment uneconomical.  Other geothermal companies will be left with the choice of starting their own equipment manufacturing wing, buying from Ormat, or paying extra for Chinese stuff.  Whatever they chose, Ormat benefits, either by gaining market share from competitors delaying their projects, spending more on their projects, or by getting more sales.  Ormat also has a energy storage division, and energy storage is rather important for when energy demand fluctuates.  All of this combines to create a golden opportunity, an opportunity Ormat's management is pouncing on.

Ormat has radically increased the rate that they are issuing debt and spending on capex.  Because geothermal is such a stable industry, they can get cheap debt and have a WACC of 4.95%.  They've also made some new hires, most notable of which is Daniel Moelk.  He was appointed senior vice president and brings experience with enhanced geothermal energy.  

TLDR: AI means more energy demand, enhanced geothermal energy means geothermal can scale now, there's a shit ton of tax incentives, and Ormat can and is taking advantage of all three.

Alibaba unveils homegrown AI chip to replace Nvidia’s H20 in China,1n350ak,callsonreddit,2025-08-29 11:36:32,1813,0.95,381,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n350ak/alibaba_unveils_homegrown_ai_chip_to_replace/,"No paywall: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-alibaba-develops-ai-chip-090846681.html

(Reuters) -China's Alibaba has developed a new chip that is more versatile than its older chips and is meant to serve a broader range of AI inference tasks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The chip, now in testing, is manufactured by a Chinese company, in contrast to an earlier Alibaba AI processor that was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the report said.

Alibaba did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Chinese tech and AI companies have been focusing heavily on homegrown technology at a time when leading AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has faced regulatory issues in selling its products in the country.

Nvidia's H20 chip, the most powerful AI processor it is allowed to sell in China, was effectively blocked from sale in the market earlier this year by the Trump administration.

While the U.S. last month allowed Nvidia to resume sales of H20 to China, Chinese firms have been working on processors that could substitute H20. Beijing has also put pressure on tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance, over purchases of the H20 chip.

Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for China following U.S. export restrictions on its other AI processors in 2023. The H20 does not have as much computing power as Nvidia's H100 or its Blackwell series.

Alibaba is China's biggest cloud-computing company and is among the top customers of Nvidia.

Separately, on Friday, the company reported a 26% jump in revenue in its cloud computing segment for the April-June quarter, beating market estimates, on the back of solid demand.",2025-08-29,-0.1298,Negative,"['AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'NVDA', 'AI', 'AI']"

Ulta Beauty rises 6% after hours after Q2 beat.

Ulta Beauty on Thursday raised its full-year forecast, after reporting growth in all major categories and topping Wall Street’s quarterly sales expectations.

The beauty retailer said it expects net sales of between $12 billion and $12.1 billion, up from its previous range of $11.5 billion and $11.7 billion, representing an increase from last fiscal year’s net sales of $11.3 billion. It expects earnings per share of $23.85 to $24.30, up from its previous range of $22.65 to $23.20.

It expects comparable sales, a metric that takes out one-time factors like store openings and closures, to grow between 2.5% to 3.5%, up from projections of as much as 1.5%. The company had raised its annual profit forecast and the upper end of its full year sales range in May.

In the company’s news release, CEO Kecia Steelman said its outlook for the year “reflects both the strength of our year-to-date performance and our caution around how consumer demand may evolve in the second half of the year.”

Shares of Ulta gained roughly 6% in extended trading, after earlier hitting a 52-week during the regular session.

Here’s what the company reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:

Earnings per share: $5.78. It was not immediately clear if that was comparable to the $5.08 expected by analysts.

Revenue: $2.79 billion vs. $2.67 billion expected

In the three-month period that ended August 2, Ulta’s net income rose to $260.88 million, or $5.78 per share, from $252.6 million, or $5.30 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased from $2.55 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Beauty has remained a hot category for consumers, even as they pull back or watch their spending in other discretionary categories. Yet that’s fueled tougher competition for Ulta Beauty as specialty players like LVMH-owned Sephora, big-box retailers like Walmart and department stores like Kohl’s have all bulked up their beauty businesses.

For investors, tariffs have been a closely watched challenge for retailers, too. Compared to other retailers, Ulta is not as directly exposed. Only about 1% of the company’s merchandise last fiscal year was direct imports, then-CFO Paula Oyibo said in May on the company’s earnings call. She said at the time most of Ulta’s exposure to the higher duties was minor, such as store fixtures and supplies.

In the second quarter, Ulta’s comparable sales grew 6.7% year over year, more than double analysts’ expectations, according to StreetAccount.

Customers visited more and spent more when they shopped on Ulta’s website and in its stores compared to the year-ago quarter. Transactions rose by 3.7% and average ticket increased by 2.9%.

Along with attracting more customers in the U.S., Ulta has looked internationally for growth. It announced in July that had acquired Space NK, a British beauty retailer, from Manzanita Capital. The deal allows Ulta to enter a new international market, since Space NK has 83 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Ulta did not disclose the price of the acquisition, saying it funded the transaction with cash on hand and Ulta’s existing credit facility and that it would not be material to financial results for the fiscal year.

The company is expanding in other international markets, too. Ulta plans to open its first stores in Mexico City, Kuwait City and Dubai later this year, CEO Kecia Steelman said on the company’s May earnings call.

Ulta is also launching a third-party marketplace later this year, a move that more retailers are making as a way to expand the mix of merchandise they carry without needing more store shelf space or buying more of their own inventory.

At the same time, Ulta recently announced the end of one of its efforts to expand reach. It cut ties with Target, which had opened mini Ulta shops in more than 600 big-box stores. The licensing deal, which will end in August 2026, allowed Target to sell a smaller and rotating assortment of makeup, skincare, hair care products and more that are carried by the full Ulta stores. Target carried those items on its website, and it staffed the shops.

Ulta is looking for a new CFO as well. The company’s former CFO, Oyibo, left Ulta in late June after about a year in the role. Ulta has not yet announced her permanent successor.",2025-08-28,0.9973,Positive,"['CEO', 'LSEG', 'LVMH', 'CFO', 'NK', 'NK', 'CEO', 'CFO', 'CFO']"

This sub is my safe haven. I do get some random random DMs calling me “regard” — that doesn’t really bother me - I end up chatting with most of them. However what does piss me off and bother me is when people close to me, particularly people I actually know, like friends - call me “lucky.” Instead I would have been fairly happy if they can just said “congrats and f*ck you!”

Like… in my opinion everything - I mean EVERYTHING is f’king luck. Born human instead of a pig = luck. Born in a family that feeds you 3 meals a day instead of starving = luck. Being alive today and the fact I woke up alive this morning = luck…

Luck is f’king everything(well at-least most things that ain’t in your control). I have always felt genuinely happy for my peeps…

Yes I was lucky - so f’king what?

$TH - Prepare Your Backdoors for this Sneaky AI/Critical Minerals 10 Bagger,1n2dcp4,regicider,2025-08-28 14:13:18,296,0.89,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n2dcp4/th_prepare_your_backdoors_for_this_sneaky/,"**TL;DR** Target Hospitality Corp. (**$TH**) now has booked contracts serving the AI datacenter infrastructure AND critical minerals industries, which are everyone’s two favorite dragons to chase right now. Calls are cheap, with an IV around 40%. With recent announcements,  $TH stock price is lower than it was in January, it has a $900 million market cap, but options are priced like a boring big-cap boomer stock.

There’s big upside on calls if market wakes up to this new reality and it makes a run to the most recent analyst target of $11. If that happens, calls are anywhere from a 3 to 10 bagger depending on how you play it. There’s even more upside if $TH picks up some heat and IV expands. And if it really runs, things will get silly quickly. We're talking 20 or 30 bagger potential  



I’m long a bunch of September and October 10c.

**The Setup**

I love a good setup, like my [Gambling on Peace play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mr7gal/gambling_on_peace/), betting on the coincidence that $KIEV ticker going live the same day that Trump met with Putin would result in the stock popping. That setup was based on $KIEV being a proxy for geopolitical progress, and it did in fact go on a nice run the following week, as I expected.

But, unlike that play, $TH is primed for a run based on business fundamentals, the market mispricing options, and $TH having mostly unnoticed exposure to hot sectors. Allow me to explain.

We all know anything within a whiff of AI infrastructure or critical minerals has gone on an absolute tear this year. (Looking at you APLD, MP, UUUU, and a bunch of small caps I can’t mention here.) That’s because there’s been an absolute stampede by giant tech companies to build a fuck ton of data centers, and the Trump administration has a giant boner for building out critical mineral supply chains in the US.

$TH just happens to have large service contracts supporting the buildout on both of these initiatives. And I think there‘s more in the works. That combined with the $TH having underpriced options means we’ve got the setup for multi-bagger in a conservative bull case, and a 10+ bagger if it really gains traction. (Sept and Oct 10c have been filling for .1 and .2, respectively. Sometimes lower.)

Ask ChatGPT “option low IV good?” if you’re not familiar with options pricing.

**The Backdoor AI Datacenter Play**

On August 18^(th), $TH announced a $43 million dollar contract supporting the buildout of a datacenter in the Southwest US. This puts them firmly in the picks-and-shovels-for-AI-infrastructure business. Analyst Stephen Gengaro from Stifel called $TH a “**back door data center play**” along with his recent price target of $11.

I think there’s going to be a lot more datacenter revenue in the future. But don’t listen to me, here’s $TH CEO Brad Archer on the datacenter contract and landscape:

>""We are excited to announce this contract and the continued progress on our strategic initiatives. This contract broadens our customer reach and further illustrates our ability to deliver comprehensive hospitality solutions across diverse commercial end‑markets. Our unique capabilities provide a critical solution supporting this **growing end‑market demand**, and we believe there are **additional opportunities to participate in the rapidly expanding technology infrastructure** **transformation**..""

**Translation:** They’re about to be tits deep in an overflowing pool of that sweet AI infrastructure revenue.

**Why settle for one backdoor when you can have two?**

What if you’re a greedy little regard who isn’t satisfied by one backdoor? Well, fellow degenerate, I have good news for you! $TH is also a backdoor play into the critical minerals boom. A picks-and-shovels-for-picks-and-shovels play, if you will. (I’ll see myself out.)

In February of this year, $TH announced a $143 million contract partnering with Lithium Americas at the Thacker Pass lithium project. And they see this as just the beginning for their critical minerals business. Here’s $TH CEO Brad Archer again, this time on this contract:

>“We are excited to announce this partnership with Lithium Americas and support the critical development of a domestic lithium supply chain. This marks a significant milestone in Target's commitment to strategic diversification, while simultaneously expanding our geographic presence. We believe the establishment of **this community will provide opportunities to pursue additional value‑enhancing growth initiatives supporting an expanding number of large, critical mineral development projects** in the region.”

**Translation:** Strap on your hardhats boys, we’re about to be digging up more critical minerals tendies!

**The Company**

At this point you may be feeling that tingle in your jingles telling you to FOMO your life savings into short-dated calls (please don’t). But first, maybe you’re wondering, “what the fuck does this company even do?” That’s a great question, and I applaud the incredible depth of your DD skills.

$TH describes themselves as, “the largest US provider of accommodations, culinary and hospitality services.” Which is just as vague and corporate-y as you would expect from a public company’s website. What they really do, is build temporary living environments for people. The also providing the things people need to live in those environments, like food, water, laundry service, cages, etc.

Think of it this way. Remember when the Death Star got blown up at the end of A New Hope? And then the Empire went all-out rebuilding a new Death Star that showed up in Return of the Jedi? Well, they would have needed to bring in a bunch of outside contractors to rebuild the Death Star so quickly. If they operated in the Star Wars Universe, $TH would be the company providing the space pods for the contractors to live in, cooking up their protein goop dinners, cleaning their space suits, etc. And if the Empire won, they probably would have built the cages they kept the Ewoks in until they got deported. But that's pure speculation on my part.

**Wait, so are these guys kind of…evil?**

I’d consider them sort of evil adjacent. But this isn’t a UNICEF convention, it’s a casino. And, they’re doing less evil stuff since they had their migrant camp contracts cancelled. By revenue, I calculate that they’re now about **78% less evil** than before. And that’s why they’ve moved on from habitats (cages) for migrant children and families, to building worker camps (unlocked cages) for nerds building data centers and guys swinging pickaxes in mines. (OK I don’t really know how mining works.)

While we're on the topic of cancelled government contracts, you may notice the stock took an absolute nosedive earlier this year. Their biggest government contract was cancelled in February, causing the drop. That shakeup forced them to focus on non-government opportunities, and they've since replaced that lost revenue with critical minerals and data center contracts. They've also renewed a government contract that was cancelled in August 2024 (the Dilley Facility). However, stock price still hasn't fully rebounded to where it was in January.

How many companies have you seen that have AI and Critical Minerals exposure and the stock price is lower than it was in January? Well, now it's at least one. You're welcome.

$TH has been also been able to put those unused assets from their cancelled contracts back to work on new contracts. The $43 million dollar datacenter contract is only going to require about $6-9 million of Capex investment, because they’re reusing the assets from previous projects.

Lots of big potential projects with minimal Capex costs = rocket ship emoji.

**Conclusion**

Ok, this is mostly the TL;DR 2, electric boogaloo.

$TH has big upside due to their unique exposure to the critical minerals and AI  infrastructure sectors, with more opportunities coming. The stock is cheaper than it was in January. Options are also very cheap, so this is a multi-bagger (or more) on relatively small moves in the stock price. And they’re 78% less evil, if you care about that sort of thing.

Remember, play it with options while they’re still cheap. If IV triples maybe sit this one out. Or, do whatever you want. Maybe FOMO your life savings into it. I don't really care.  I’m not a financial advisor and this isn’t financial advice.

**Update -** added a shares position in my 401k. I like the short term and long term outlook here.

CRWV BULLISH DD,1n21jmh,ArteezyILLEGAL,2025-08-28 03:19:56,146,0.85,161,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n21jmh/crwv_bullish_dd/,"Alright listen up you red crayon eaters. Because it is time to turn your -90% portfolios to +400%.

CoreWeave has been bashed in recent times due to mounting debts. But not many billionaires would advise you to keep emergency cash in fact, borrowing is the meta to becoming rich. The printer never stops, you just need to outgrow inflation and grab all that newly minted benjamins. If CoreWeave was a soy boy, they'd be delisted in 2 years. To win, you need to take risks, and CoreWeave has done exactly that.

Sure their business model is absolutely asset intensive but 99% of men love assets. But enough yappers. Because I will show you some calculations on the breakdown on their CAPEX, and estimated OPEX.

Before we begin, as with most bullshit corporate documents, I will outline assumptions based on Gemini-able, GPT-able, GROX-able information. We will be assuming land cost, PUE, construction costs, and IT costs in estimates. Utility prices will be taken off latest available information off the net.

CoreWeave has reported that they are on track to deliver up to 900MW in their 2025 guidance. This is almost double their current active capacity, sitting at 470MW. But oh boy those datacenters they are gonna erect will give many Wallstreet Buffets wannabe ED. Sure, datacenters are expensive but the premium of these bad boy Grace and Blackwell supercomputers can command gives me viagra on crack and Redbull. The following calculations are all based in USD.

**First up CAPEX (on 430MW)**

Hard Construction Costs: $18M per Megawatt  
Soft Construction Costs: 20% of Hard Construction Costs  
Land Required/MW: \~550m^(2) (5,920ft^(2) for retards)  
Land Cost/m^(2) : $20  
Jensen Baby Cost per GB300 NVL72: \~$3M (each takes up 130kW)  
Assume 80% Fit-out of GB300 NVL72: 2,646 GB300 NVL72s = $7,939M  
Other supporting racks/IT (20% fit-out): $5M/MW = $430M

**Total CAPEX = $7,939M + $430M + $4.73M + $7,740M + $1,548M = $17,661.73M**

**Next up OPEX (on 430MW)**

Total IT Power = 430MW  
Assumed PUE = 1.2  
Total Power Consumption = 516MW  
Commercial Power Price = $0.1185/kWh  
Total Cost for Energy = $535.64M/year

Estimated Water Consumption = 2m^(3)/hour/MW  
Commercial Water Price = $6/m^(3)  
Total Price of Water = $45.21M/year

Asset Maintenance for IT (including depreciation): 5% of IT Cost/year  
Total Maintenance cost for IT = $418.45M/year  
Asset Maintenance for Electrical Systems: 3% of System Cost/year (41% of Construction Cost)  
Total Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $95.20M/year  
Asset Maintenance for Mechanical Systems: 4% of System Cost/year (25% of Construction Cost)  
Total Maintenance cost for Electrical Systems = $77.40M/year

Headcount: estimated 806, prorated  
Estimated average payroll/head: $150,000  
Total payroll: $120.9M/ year

**Total Annual OPEX = $535.64M + $45.21M + $418.45M + $95.20M + $77.40M + $120.9M = $1292.80M (excl interest expenses and depreciation)**

Considering CRWV announced capital expenditure of $20 \~ $23 billion, probably likely includes financing leases and acquisition of Core Scientific. But what the hell do they mean?

Based on earlier Q2 earnings suggests, the revenue per Megawatt is \~$11M. If we scale that up without considering any premium for the GB200/GB300, the revenue for just this 430MW is \~$4.73B, logically speaking, we might be looking at almost $5.4B instead.

Tech refresh cycles that is gonna be 3/4 years for these chips, that's fair. But these chips don't just go obsolete / worthless because some accountant deems their ""useful"" life a certain number of years. They can be repurposed, if they retain even 30% of their value in 3 years, the ROI will look even better, and eventually, D&A becomes very misleading and conservative. The buildings and infrastructure are good for 10, 20 years so retrofitting them at fraction of the initial construction costs to suit future needs.

Considering EBITDA, the ROI is as low as 4.4 years, and based on GAAP, the ROI could be 10 years (4 years cycle). And if we consider 30% resale value of these chips at end of 4 years, the ROI can be 8.7 years.

Currently, the FY25 guidance are reporting a mix of Hopper racks and maybe just a quarter of GB200/GB300. As CRWV gain more contracts using GB200 & GB300, and if they can grab and monopolize much of the available Blackwell chips, CRWV can command a higher premium. NVDA's stake in CRWV allows them to get priority access to latest chips, and they are very likely to be first to deploy the Vera Rubin slated to launch in 2026.

The whole AI shenanigans is still at the infant stages, all these large language models is really just the beginning. CRWV having 2.2GW of contracted capacity after acquiring Core Scientific is a calculated and strategic step to ensure they have room to grow at the pace they want to meet the demand they see.

Please do fact check my numbers if you have actual industry knowledge in the US, but they should be in the higher range. I highly believe actual numbers are even more optimistic.

**TLDR:** CoreWeave is basically lighting money on fire today so it can sell compute at premium tomorrow. Their $20–23B capex plan is insane scale, but it checks out: racks of $3M GB200/GB300, $18M/MW concrete palaces, and power bills that could run a small country.

Yes, depreciation nukes GAAP, but that’s just accounting cosplay — the GPUs don’t turn to dust after 3 years, they still earn or can be resold. Interest costs are a real drag, but adjusted EBITDA margins (\~60%+) show the core biz is printing.

The risk? Expansion outpaces demand or tech cycles compress faster than resale value. The upside? CRWV has Nvidia’s golden ticket, first dibs on new silicon, and 2.2GW of contracted capacity locked. Revenue will double, as a low hanging fruit next year.

**Position:** 175 shares @ $92.00 avg.

Numbers go brrr, depreciation makes GAAP cry, but the growth story is very real.

BitFarms $BITF High-Performance Computing Play,1n1i1vn,DonaldPump1,2025-08-27 14:07:49,76,0.88,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n1i1vn/bitfarms_bitf_highperformance_computing_play/,"**Strategic Shift to AI and HPC:** The company is accelerating its move into high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. This strategic diversification beyond just Bitcoin mining is seen as a positive step for future growth and has been highlighted in analyst reports. Bitfarms has already announced a partnership with T5 Data Centers to develop its Panther Creek campus for HPC/AI

  
**On August 18, 2025, Bitfarms announced the appointment of Wayne Duso, a former Amazon Web Services (AWS) executive, to its Board of Directors**. This appointment is a significant development because of Bitfarms' strategic pivot towards high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Duso's extensive experience at AWS, where he helped scale and lead several businesses in data storage and cloud infrastructure, is seen as a major asset to this new direction.

Similarly, **Terawulf $WULF** stocks recent surge is primarily due to a major strategic shift from Bitcoin mining to providing high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. 

**Massive AI Hosting Deal with Fluidstack:** TeraWulf announced a 10-year agreement with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. This initial agreement is valued at approximately **$3.7 billion** and can potentially grow to **$8.7 billion** if extensions are exercised. 

**Google ($GOOGL)'s** recently announced providing a **$1.8 billion backstop** for Fluidstack's lease obligations and has taken an **8% equity stake** in TeraWulf

  
**TLDR:**  I'm expecting $BITF to sign a HPC deal in near future causing stock price to surge.

(Nasdaq short interest stats https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ibrx/short-interest) So today there was some initial data released on its effectiveness of its treatment being 100% though thats across 5 people which doesn't hold much water but even then the hype only moved this stock 5% (https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3080031/immunitybio-ibrx-shares-rise-on-promising-glioblastoma-trial-results) which makes me think that this definitely has a lot of room to run on positive news and could lead to outrageous parabolic moves as shorts cover and with a new anylist price target of 24 dollars implies a ~90% upside.

I then compared the next day's option prices in a best case, sell at the top scenario, and worst case, sell at the bottom. 

The results so far, and mind you this is only a small sample size, have actually been kind of funny. If you blindly invested this way, and sold at the top the next day, you'd be up 21%.

* [https://about.att.com/story/2025/echostar.html](https://about.att.com/story/2025/echostar.html)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -AT&T said on Tuesday it will purchase key wireless spectrum licenses from EchoStar for about $23 billion, as the the U.S. telecom provider seeks to boost its network in a competitive market.

In June, President Donald Trump prodded satellite communications and Dish TV parent EchoStar and Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr to reach an amicable deal over the fate of the company's wireless spectrum licenses, the company said.

The deal marks the latest major investment by AT&T to accelerate its fiber and 5G network build-out as the wireless market saturates and internet usage surges.

Shares of EchoStar jumped more than 40% in premarket trading, while AT&T rose 1.5%.

In May, the FCC told EchoStar it was investigating the company's compliance obligations to provide 5G service in the United States, questioning EchoStar's buildout extension and mobile-satellite service.

Trump met on June 12 with EchoStar Chair Charlie Ergen and later called Carr to take part in the meeting. EchoStar had been seeking to shield its cache of wireless spectrum licenses from the threat of revocation by the FCC.

EchoStar said the AT&T deal is part of its ongoing efforts to resolve the FCC's inquiries.

""This transaction puts our business on a solid financial path, further facilitating EchoStar's long-term success, and enhancing our ability to innovate and compete as a hybrid network operator,"" said EchoStar CEO Hamid Akhavan, adding it continues to evaluate strategic opportunities for its remaining spectrum portfolio.

U.S. satellite TV provider DirecTV terminated its agreement to acquire EchoStar's satellite television business last year, which includes rival Dish TV, over a failed debt-exchange offer.

In May, AT&T clinched a deal to acquire Lumen Technologies' consumer fiber operations for $5.75 billion in cash.

AT&T's bundled plans that combine high-speed fiber with mobile offerings have resonated well with customers as rivals like T-Mobile and Verizon double down on promotions.

The company added 401,000 net monthly bill-paying wireless phone subscribers during the April to June period.

Meren Energy is the cheapest oil company in the world $MER.TO [DD],1n01x1v,Virtual_Seaweed7130,2025-08-25 20:37:05,85,0.89,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1n01x1v/meren_energy_is_the_cheapest_oil_company_in_the/,"Regard warning: This company actually generates operating income, so it might not be for you.

Meren Energy, formerly Africa Oil Corp, TO:$MER , is a offshore oil company. The company focuses on the production, development, exploration, and appraisal of oil and gas assets in deep-water Nigeria. The company has been around forever, with various operations in Africa, and had a formidable stake from the Lundin group for any materials investors.

Their most significant asset in recent years has been partial ownership on their balance sheet of Prime Oil & Gas, a company that is contracted to do offshore drilling at Agbami (Chevron-operated, OML 127/PML 52) and Akpo + Egina (TotalEnergies-operated, OML 130/PMLs 2–4). These are three of the top five oil-producing fields in West Africa. They're contract drillers that get a portion of the production as payment.

The fields will continue to produce for many years. OML 130 (Akpo/Egina/Preowei) was renewed for 20 years in May 2023, Agbami’s concession was renewed through 2044 under Nigeria’s PIA.

Recently, Meren Energy changed structure from equity income to full consolidation. The Prime deal closing (Mar 20, 2025) transformed Meren from a 50% look-through holder of Prime’s cash to full owner, doubling reserves and production and centralizing cash on Meren’s balance sheet. The company cited \~$460m cash and guided to $320–370m operating cash flow in 2025 at $75 Brent.

Management set a base dividend of $100m/yr and committed to return ≥50% of excess FCF via dividends and buybacks. The company is worth \~800M today.

Here's their recent dividends:

* 1Q25 dividend: $25m
* 2Q25 dividend: $25m
* 3Q25 dividend: $25m

Meren forecasts 2025 operating cash flow $320–370m at $75 Brent. capex $150–190m. That's at $75/crude though, and we're closer to $65.

Meren's 2024 total reserves based on Prime ownership entitlement after royalties + taxes is reported at 50.8 MMboe.

At $65 crude, which is very low, this is \~3.3B of revenue, and with capex+opex at less than half of their revenue, you're looking for at least 1.6B of cash from operations from these reserves, the company has a 800M market cap.

Despite being approved to operate through \~2040, the current reserves at 127/130 are depleting. They have about \~8 years of operation remaining at current reserves, but this could easily increase. They have Project Venus is slated to start in 2030 and could add significantly to their production and 2P reserves. But even without this, current production justifies the price.

If getting double the market cap in cash flow wasn't enough, you also get free call options on exploration and development projects the company owns. These are NOT in production.

1. Namibia/South Africa Block 3B/4B: Meren holds an 18% non-operated interest in a offshore exploration block operated by TotalEnergies. The block is located in the Orange Basin, offshore Namibia.
2. Equatorial Guinea Blocks EG-18 and EG-31: Meren holds 80% operated interests in each block.

Overall, you're getting the company for half of what its production assets are worth at a depressed oil price ($65/barrel), and you get all the exploration upside for free. And this exploration upside is arguably worth more than the current production assets.

TL;DR: Meren is 1/2 NPV at $65 oil + free exploration, PT of $4, $25M quarterly dividend (11% yield) will keep you paid until then.

However, because of the fact that I'm currently reading a book about the Fed called *The Lords of Easy Money: How the Federal Reserve Broke the American Economy,* I'm pretty sure this is bullshit. A small interest rate cut is not going to improve the employment figures. Even after the financial crisis it took many years to improve the employment figures. And that's when interest rates were at 0%. Honestly, the unemployment figures aren't that bad. The unemployment rate has been stagnating between 4% and 4.2%, between June 2024 and August 2025. Inflation seems much more worrying in that regard. Powell mentioned that inflation was quite entrenched in the US, while The Economist brought an article last week that said that from a pool of 10 first world countries (Britain, US, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea ...), inflation in the US was the least entrenched. The current expectation for inflation in the US is 5.5%, which is insane. That's 2.3% higher than the current inflation rate. On top of that it was also strange to say that tariffs account for a one time increase in prices. POTUS is changing tariff rates on countries/goods every month. The effective tariff rate is also still 8 times higher than the effective tariff rates were last year and still the highest effective tariff rate since The Great Depression. And currently these tariff rates have not found their way to customers yet (or not to a highly effect), because a lot of companies keep paying them (hoping that Trump will change his mind and they don't lose customers). Also because they stockpiled a lot of goods before the start of the tariffs.

So what is really going on? Because currently things don't seem to make a lot of sense to me.

Here is $388k worth of ROOT shares across my 3 different retirement accounts. 



**WHY the big drop recently?**

I bought these back on August 6th in anticipation of a huge earnings beat, and that's exactly what I got! They beat EPS expectations by 148% and revenue expectations by 8%. I was rewarded with a 10% pop post earnings, which I did not cash out, only to see the stock plummet the next day. This is because the CEO gave poor guidance during the earnings call, citing a one time expense due to ROOTs warrants with Carvana.

  
**This stock is undervalued!**

To me, this stock was undervalued at $120+ and now it's extremely undervalued at $90.  It has a P/E ratio of 17.46 which is very low considering LMND doesn't even make money and ROOTs earnings are growing at an insane clip. Sure they posted bad guidance, but that just means lower expectations for an even bigger Q3 earnings beat.

  
**Are there any catalysts?**

For me, the next big catalysts are September 3rd, 9th, and 25th where ROOTs CEO and CFO will meet with institutional investors at some investor conferences. If they make a good impression, we could see more investors pile in at current prices and begin a nice upward trend into Q3 earnings.

RDDT and GOOG were the big contributors. Both of which, I'm still holding strong with!

I'm holding some significant hedges via puts in TSLA and PLTR.

This morning I collected data from last week's earnings post and compiled options plays that got at least 10 upvotes.  I compared the closing price of the stock and its movement the next day to see if WSB is good at picking earnings plays or not.  The results were mixed.

With top rated comments, WSB has a win rate of 57%, which is positive.  However, with a 57% win rate, you better have some damn good risk management, or your portfolio is going to slowly bleed.  In addition, this analysis doesn't take options cost or strike price into consideration, so with decent IV, a win on this spreadsheet could actually be a loss; for example, I included two PANW plays which were technically wins because they called them correctly, but a loss because of strike price.

Zoom was the notable, terrible WSB pick.  Almost everyone, from highly upvoted comments to comments with only 1-2 votes, picked Zoom to tank.  Target was a notable, great WSB pick, as most people picked Puts and it moved significantly, likely making any Put holders profit, even through high IV.

My conclusion: following WSB on earnings is incredibly risky.  Besides the low win rate, people tend to pile on to stocks with incredibly high IV and then get crushed after earnings.",2025-08-24,0.9211,Positive,"['WSB', 'WSB', 'IV', 'PANW', 'WSB', 'WSB', 'IV', 'WSB', 'IV']"

"Alcohol consumption hits 85-year low: Molson Coors volume down 7%, Constellation down 3.3%, giants pivot to non-alcoholic growth",1myhxdw,callsonreddit,2025-08-24 00:41:48,1869,0.98,502,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1myhxdw/alcohol_consumption_hits_85year_low_molson_coors/,"No paywall: [https://www.aol.com/americans-arent-drinking-anymore-alcohol-203502637.html](https://www.aol.com/americans-arent-drinking-anymore-alcohol-203502637.html)

Cold beer on a Friday night? Maybe non-alcoholic.

Only 54% of drinking-age Americans consume alcohol today, according to a recent poll from Gallup, the lowest proportion since the survey began in 1939. Even those who do drink are partaking less, by a factor of nearly half.

The US is drinking less, and cultural connotations around alcohol consumption have shifted. The number of Americans who see drinking as bad for their health has increased every year since 2016, according to Gallup.

These changes are hurting the country's biggest alcohol producers, forcing them to find ways to adapt to what might, according to several experts, be the early stages of a tobacco-like sea change for alcohol.

On Coors-maker Molson Coors' (TAP) most recent earnings call, an analyst buzzed in to ask: Could consumer behavior get worse before it gets better? Or was the distributor seeing any bullish signs?

""Candidly,"" CEO Gavin Hattersley said, ""we have not seen an improvement in overall consumer confidence or behavior.""

When the country's drinking giants released their latest earnings, they reported slowdowns in volume growth across the board. Among the largest names in the industry, Molson Coors and Corona distributor Constellation Brands (STZ) took the hardest hits, recording volume declines of 7% and 3.3%, respectively.

Anheuser-Busch (BUD) and Sam Adams parent Boston Beer Company (SAM) fared slightly better, with beer volume declines of 1.9% and 0.8%, respectively.

""The industry,"" said Bottle Raiders vice president of marketing Amanda Paul-Garnier, ""has never faced as much pressure as it does today.""

# Alcohol's Big Tobacco moment?

In the 1960s, smoking was deeply embedded in American life.

Ads selling cigarettes were regularly slotted into commercial breaks on TV. Restaurants, airplanes, and even hospitals were filled with smoke. Nearly half of the country were regular smokers.

That all changed in January 1964, when Surgeon General Luther Terry released a report that would almost overnight shift Americans' tobacco habits — the first to make a direct link between smoking and cancer.

It turned out to be a watershed moment for Big Tobacco.

Within five years, Congress had passed a series of laws that required warning labels on all tobacco products and banned cigarette ads throughout broadcast media. The percentage of Americans who smoked had dropped by 5%, according to the American Lung Association.

The alcohol industry is now having to contend with the same health-conscious movement that hit tobacco. In January, former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a damning report linking alcohol consumption to cancer risk and calling for measures including warning labels on alcoholic drink containers, just like the ones adorning every box of cigarettes sold in the US.

Consuming one drink per day, the report found, raises the risk of alcohol-related cancer by 19% in women and 11.4% in men. Having two drinks per day bumps those figures to 21.8% and 13.1%, respectively.

According to Peter Monti, a professor at Brown University who studies alcohol use and addiction, the public hadn't previously appreciated that link, but he sees the possibility for that to shift.

""We've really reversed attitudes, beliefs, and behavior with respect to tobacco in a way that I think we could for alcohol, as well,"" Monti said in January. Moderated drinking, Monti told Yahoo Finance, is ""more popular now than ever before.""

Culture might already be moving.

The results of the Gallup poll reflect ""a shift that has been building in society for quite some time,"" Paul-Garnier told Yahoo Finance.

Alcohol consumption has dropped every year since 2022, down from 67% of Americans reporting that they use alcohol to only 54%, according to Gallup.

And the trend isn't confined to any one demographic.

Only 1 in 2 of the 18- to 34-year-old young adult crowd reported that they drink alcohol, down from 59% in 2023. Consumption levels for both the 35- to 54-year-olds and the 55-plus cohort sit at 56%, down 10 and 5 percentage points, respectively, over the past two years. The drop also holds true across all income levels.

""All signs suggest alcohol is following a trajectory similar to tobacco,"" Paul-Garnier said.

And among those who do drink, the frequency with which they do so is falling. Twenty years ago, survey participants who consumed alcohol had an average of 5.1 drinks in the seven days prior to taking the survey. Now, that figure is just over half what it was, at 2.8 drinks.

“Consumers … continue to be social, enjoying their moments,"" Anheuser-Busch CEO Michel Doukeris said on the company's second quarter earnings call. But now, they are ""more in control of their entire consumption.""",2025-08-24,0.846,Positive,"['US', 'TAP', 'CEO', 'STZ', 'BUD', 'SAM', 'TV', 'US', 'US', 'CEO']"

This biotech gem got a major win in May 2025 with FDA approval for its combo drug, Avmapki Fakzynja Co-pack (avutometinib and defactinib), targeting KRAS-mutated recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). What you non-medical regards see as alphabet soup, I see as dollar signs.

Let me break down the future potential:

Since the FDA approval, VSTM’s stock hasn’t gotten the hype it deserves, considering everyone is overlooking their pipeline in pancreatic cancer and lung cancer. Their current approval will give them the runway to fuel these clinical trials to avoid future debt. The pricing for Avmapki Fakzynja is estimated at $20,000/month/patient, or $240,000/year/patient. The U.S. market for LGSOC is 6,000–8,000 patients. If Verastem captured every U.S. patient (unrealistic, but bear 🐻 with me), that’s $1.44–$1.92 billion in potential annual revenue. More conservatively, scaling to $400 million in sales is achievable, especially since there are zero competing targeted therapies for KRAS-mutated LGSOC, giving Verastem a first-mover edge.

Compare that to the current market cap, and the stock looks extremely undervalued. Verastem reported $2.1 million in Q2 2025 revenue just weeks after launch, showing early traction.

Federal Reserve Powell indicates conditions ‘may warrant’ interest rate cuts as Fed proceeds ‘carefully’,1mx7qdb,NewSlinger,2025-08-22 14:16:21,820,0.98,181,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mx7qdb/federal_reserve_powell_indicates_conditions_may/,"URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/powell-indicates-conditions-may-warrant-interest-rate-cuts-as-fed-proceeds-carefully.html


Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday gave a tepid indication of possible interest rate cuts ahead as he noted a high level of uncertainty that is making the job difficult for monetary policymakers.

In his much-anticipated speech at the Fed’s annual conclave in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the central bank leader in prepared remarks cited “sweeping changes” in tax, trade and immigration policies. The result is that “the balance of risks appear to be shifting” between the Fed’s twin goals of full employment and stable prices.


While he noted that the labor market remains in good shape and the economy has shown “resilience,” he said downside dangers are rising. At the same time, he said tariffs are causing risks that inflation could rise again — a stagflation scenario that the Fed needs to avoid.

With the Fed’s benchmark interest rate a full percentage point below where it was when Powell delivered his keynote a year ago, and the unemployment rate still low, conditions allow “us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,” Powell said.

“Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he added.

That was as close as he came during the speech to endorsing a rate cut that Wall Street widely believes is coming when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets Sept. 16-17.

However, the remarks were enough to send stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
 showed a gain of more than 600 points following the public release of Powell’s speech while the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury note
 saw a 0.08 percentage point fall to around 3.71%.

In addition to market expectations, President Donald Trump has demanded aggressive cuts from the Fed in scathing public attacks he has lobbed at Powell and his colleagues.

The Fed has held its benchmark borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5% since December. Policymakers have continued to cite the uncertain impact that tariffs will have on inflation as a reason for caution and believe that current economic conditions and the slightly restrictive policy stance allow for time to make further decisions.

Importance of Fed independence
While not addressing the White House demands for lower rates specifically, Powell did note the importance of Fed independence.

“FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach,” he said.

The speech comes amid ongoing negotiations between the White House and its global trading partners, a situation often in flux and without clarity on where it will end. Recent indicators show consumer prices gradually pushing higher but wholesale costs up more rapidly.

From the Trump administration view, the tariffs will not cause lasting inflation, thus warranting rate cuts. Powell’s position in the speech was that a range of outcomes is possible, with a “reasonable base case” being that the tariff impacts will be “short lived — a one-time shift in the price level” that likely would not be cause for holding rates higher. However, he said nothing is certain at this point.

“It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks,” Powell said. “Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.”

In addition to summarizing the current conditions and potential outcomes, the speech touched on the Fed’s five-year review of its policy framework. The review resulted in several notable changes from when the central bank last performed the task in 2020.

At that time, in the midst of the Covid pandemic, the Fed switched to a “flexible average inflation targeting” regime that effectively would allow inflation to run higher than the Fed’s 2% goal coming after a prolonged period of holding below that level. The upshot is that policymakers could be patient with slightly higher inflation if it meant insuring a more comprehensive labor market recovery.

However, shortly after adopting the strategy, inflation began to climb, ultimately hitting 40-year highs, while policymakers largely dismissed the rise as “transitory” and not needing rate hikes. Powell noted the damaging impacts from the inflation and the lessons learned.

“As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021,” Powell said. “The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities.”

Also during the review, the Fed reaffirmed its commitment to its 2% inflation target. There have been critics on both sides of the issue, with some suggesting the rate is too high and can lead to a weaker dollar, while others seeing a need for the central bank to be flexible.

“We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored,” Powell said.",2025-08-22,-0.8385,Negative,"['URL', 'FOMC']"

(Reuters) -Intuit forecast first-quarter revenue growth below analysts' estimates on Thursday, hit by sluggish performance at its marketing platform Mailchimp, sending the shares down nearly 6% in extended trading.

The company provides products such as tax-preparation software TurboTax, personal finance portal Credit Karma and accounting software QuickBooks.

Mailchimp, acquired in 2021 and housed within Intuit's Global Business Solutions unit, saw its fourth-quarter revenue decline slightly, the company said.

CFO Sandeep Aujla told Reuters that Mailchimp is a near-term drag on growth, but the company has initiatives underway and expects it to be performing well by the year-end.

""The small businesses are the bread and butter of Mailchimp,"" Aujla said, adding they found it ""a bit harder to use"", which hurts retention and expansion.

Intuit has largely completed the shift from QuickBooks Desktop licenses to subscriptions and closed the pricing gap with QuickBooks Online, resulting in slower Desktop growth.

Excluding Mailchimp, the revenue growth slowdown is due to lower contribution from price increases expected in fiscal 2026, particularly in Desktop, the company said.

With the launch of AI agents — systems capable of taking actions on behalf of users — for its QuickBooks portfolio, Intuit also raised the prices of its QuickBooks Online and Payroll subscription services last month.

""Every time we do a price change, we realize that we were too conservative, but customer attrition ends up being below our expectations,"" Aujla said.

Intuit expects fiscal 2026 revenue to be between $21 billion and $21.19 billion, largely in line with analysts' average estimate of $21.12 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Its annual adjusted profit per share forecast of $22.98 to $23.18 was also broadly in line with estimates of $23.

The company's projection for first-quarter revenue growth of 14% to 15% came in below estimates of 16.1% growth.

Intuit forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.12 for the quarter, compared with estimates of $3.07.

The fourth-quarter revenue grew 20% to $3.83 billion, beating estimates of $3.75 billion. The adjusted EPS of $2.75 also exceeded estimates of $2.66.

Additionally, Intuit's board approved a new $3.2 billion share buyback, lifting total repurchase authorization to $5.3 billion.",2025-08-21,0.9779,Positive,"['CFO', 'AI', 'LSEG', 'EPS']"

Shepherd of Markets and Steadying Hand of Finance,
We humbly gather before the sacred altar of monetary policy.

Bless us not with stubborn hikes nor the burden of tightening,
But with the mercy of a gentle cut —
At least a quarter of one percent,
That our mortgages may ease,
Our businesses may breathe,
And our portfolios may rejoice.

Grant wisdom to your speeches,
Calm to your press conferences,
And clarity to the dot plots that guide the flock.

May the labor market stay strong,
Inflation drift softly downward,
And prosperity flow as freely as liquidity at the discount window.

In Powell we trust,
In cuts we hope,
And in patience we wait.

Joseph Chalom, the former head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, just joined the company a few weeks ago. He was the man responsible for creating IBIT (Bitcoin ETF) and ETHA (Ethereum ETF). He has deep ties to tradfi, and I think he will help pump up ETH price dramatically, along with Tom Lee.

**But why SBET instead of BMNR?** BMNR has a much higher mNAV, which is a premium for its ETH holdings. The problem is, they are not transparent with their calculations so it's not even easy to calculate BMNR's mNAV.

As for SBET, their mNAV just reached 1.0! Meaning, you are not paying ANY premium for its ETH holdings.

So why hold SBET over ETHA or ETH? Well, at this point, if you are bullish on Ethereum, you can buy any of the three. But CURRENTLY, because SBET has NO premium over its Net Asset Value (ETH holdings), I think it's better than ETH. Because it will track ETH 1:1, but also has some upside JUST IN CASE the mNAV goes to 1.5-2.0 like many other treasuries are currently trading at.

**TLDR:**

\-Assumption: ETH will go up in value in the short, medium, and long terms. But SBET is better because there is potential for mNAV expansion. So same downside risk as ETH, but potential more upside.

\-SBET is better than ETHA because SBET stakes their ETH, while ETHA does not have staking yet. Plus, there is potential for mNAV expansion.

Very blessed that this was only about ~ 12% of my net worth but still took a heavy toll on me. I’m a very frugal person and rarely spend my money on pleasures so spending 120k on nothing fucked me up. I never intended to trade, I had put some money in Robinhood for the gold yield (ironically because I was even scared to go into the S&P at the time) and lost a lot of money quick on 0dte options. My big pitfall was instead of leaving it there, I decided since I lost the money from trading I’d have to make it back through trading to be even. Instead of doubling down on business, I doubled down on what got me in the hole in the first place. For anyone who’s down I recommend moving on. Realize you are gambling if you are playing with low dte options. If you want to make your money back, work on getting a promotion, excelling your business, whatever you did to get that money initially. Don’t make the same mistake as me. Glad to leave this all in the past and learn a valuable lesson. I wouldn’t want to ever live on such an unstable foundation. S&P only for me here on out. And focusing on business. Leaving this brutal loss in the past and never touching options or any stocks for that matter ever again. Unless you’re planning to be a full time trader which you’re highly unlikely to succeed in, it really is just a waste of time and an emotional rollercoaster. Even if I could be a trader I wouldn’t want to be after realizing the brutal psychology behind it. And if you are still planning to trade, for the love of god don’t touch options.

I YOLO’d my entire $1.11M portfolio into Root ($ROOT) — here’s why,1mvpy8w,Latter_Remove1314,2025-08-20 20:14:22,1586,0.9,1091,https://i.redd.it/hmu49tcjf8kf1.jpeg,"I think Root ($ROOT) might be the most undervalued stock in the market right now. Trading at around $87, I’ve got a price target of $250. Sounds bold, but hear me out — this thing has 4–5x potential in the next year if the market wakes up.

The Insurtech Angle
Insurance is still stuck in the Stone Age. Progressive (~$150B market cap) and Geico (under Berkshire) dominate, but they’re slow, legacy players. Root is built different — AI, behavioral data, smarter underwriting. Auto insurance is a $300B+ market, and Root is going straight at it with a digital-first approach.

Valuation is Laughable:
Here’s the part that blows my mind:
	•	Root trades at 0.5× sales. That’s basically giving the business away. Lemonade trades closer to 3× sales. Even boring legacy players like Progressive and Allstate are valued higher on a sales basis.
	•	On earnings, Root is around 16–17× P/E. The average peer group is closer to 50–60×. Root’s trading at one-third the multiple despite showing improving fundamentals.

If Root just re-rated to industry averages, the stock would already be north of $200.

The Profitability Shift:
This isn’t the “cash-burning tech startup” it used to be. Loss ratios are improving, underwriting discipline is much tighter, and their AI models are starting to show real results. The recent dip is because of heavier AI spending, but that’s actually a good thing — they’re investing now to build a moat that pays off for years.

Market Share Optionality:
Progressive didn’t get huge overnight — it just chipped away year after year. Root doesn’t need anywhere close to that kind of dominance. Even a few percentage points of market share in a $300B+ industry makes them worth multiples of today’s price. Their digital-first brand also resonates way more with younger customers than legacy insurers ever will.

Asymmetric Bet:
At $87, the risk feels limited. The upside? Massive. Root has moved past the “will it survive” stage — they’re showing operating leverage, improving fundamentals, and real customer growth. If the market starts valuing it anywhere close to peers, this could easily be a 4–5x move.

Why It’s Being Slept On:
	•	It’s small and undercovered.
	•	Doesn’t have Lemonade’s retail hype.
	•	AI spend looks like “costs” instead of “investment” to short-sighted investors.

That’s what makes this such a great setup. Misunderstood, overlooked, undervalued.

Bottom line: Root could be the Progressive of this generation. When Progressive was small, people dismissed it too — now it’s worth $150B. Root doesn’t need to get anywhere close to that for today’s investors to make a killing.

That’s why I’ve got a $250 price target. To me, 4–5x upside in a year isn’t crazy at all — it’s just the market finally pricing Root fairly.",2025-08-20,0.9857,Positive,"['ROOT', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI']"

Reverse Repo Market Crunch,1mvlwv5,sarhama072,2025-08-20 17:48:32,649,0.93,203,https://i.redd.it/eb79kmrip7kf1.jpeg,"1. What the Chart Shows

	•	The chart tracks Reverse Repo (RRP) balances at the Federal Reserve from 2020–2025.
	•	RRPs are short-term transactions where the Fed borrows cash overnight from money market funds, offering Treasuries as collateral. It’s a liquidity-absorption tool.
	•	The yellow line shows RRP usage peaking above $2.5 trillion in 2022–2023 (money markets parking excess cash at the Fed).
	•	As of now, RRP has collapsed to $57.49 billion — a 4-year low (highlighted in red).

This means the pool of easily available short-term liquidity is almost gone.

2. Why Reverse Repo Matters

	•	When RRP is high, it means cash is abundant in money markets, and institutions don’t need to chase Treasury yields.
	•	When RRP drains down, the “cash buffer” is depleted. Money market funds and banks have less excess cash to lend back into the system.

In other words, RRP balances act as a liquidity reservoir. Once that reservoir is empty, demand for Treasuries (short-term and long-term) must come from “real” buyers — pension funds, foreign investors, banks — who demand higher yields.

3. How This Can Freeze Fed Lending

The Fed’s ability to provide liquidity to the Treasury market and the banking system relies on a two-way street:
	1.	Repo: Fed injects liquidity into the system (lends cash, takes collateral).
	2.	Reverse Repo: Fed drains liquidity (takes cash, gives collateral).

	•	With RRP balances drained, the Fed loses a cushion of voluntary lenders.
	•	If the Treasury keeps issuing large amounts of debt, but there’s no extra cash parked at the Fed to absorb it, buyers will require much higher interest rates.
	•	This can “freeze” the Fed’s ability to smoothly fund government deficits without crowding out private credit markets.

4. Role of Fiscal Policy Under Trump Administration

	•	The Trump administration (like Biden before) is pursuing continued fiscal expansion — large deficits, more government spending, and aggressive borrowing.
	•	Treasury Issuance Surges: To fund deficits, the Treasury must issue ever-larger amounts of debt.
	•	With RRP drained, there’s no excess cash pool left to absorb that debt issuance at low rates.
	•	The only way the market clears this oversupply of Treasuries is through higher yields (to attract buyers like pensions, banks, and foreign funds).

Thus, Trump’s fiscal expansion becomes the direct fuel for yield spikes.

5. Why Reverse Repo Depletion Matters for Equities

	•	Liquidity Drain: Equity valuations (especially tech and growth stocks) thrive on abundant liquidity. As RRP balances collapse, that liquidity reservoir disappears.
	•	Higher Discount Rates: Stock valuations are based on discounted future cash flows. Rising yields mean higher discount rates → lower present values of stocks.
	•	Crowding Out: As Treasuries yield more, investors rotate out of riskier equities into “risk-free” government bonds. This reduces demand for stocks.
	•	Volatility Risk: Liquidity stress in money markets can spill into credit spreads, funding costs, and margin availability — adding instability to equities.

In short, when yields rise due to a lack of systemic liquidity, stocks face both valuation compression and weaker capital flows.

Starting today, customers can search Amazon Autos to browse, finance, and purchase from thousands of used Hertz fleet vehicles from brands like Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Nissan, and others. Hertz Car Sales, the rental car firm's used car sales arm, will be the first fleet dealer on Amazon Autos.

""Our goal is to reimagine the car-buying experience and meet customers where they are — whether online or in person — with convenience, confidence and scale,"" Hertz Car Sales executive vice president Jeff Adams said in a statement. ""Amazon Autos is the ideal partner to help us deliver on this as customers can shop our expansive inventory of high-quality used cars on the same trusted marketplace where millions shop every day.""

Hertz said sales will begin in the Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle metro areas, with plans to expand to Hertz Car Sales' 45 locations nationwide. After customers complete their purchase online, they can pick up the vehicles at Hertz locations in those cities.

""This collaboration allows us to offer an expanded selection of well-maintained vehicles from more dealerships across the country, while maintaining the simplicity that customers expect from Amazon,” Global Head of Amazon Autos Fan Jin said in a statement.

Hertz will offer a 115-point inspection process and a 12-month/12,000-mile powertrain warranty. Hertz is also adding a seven-day/250-mile buyback guarantee and 24-hour roadside assistance.

Amazon's addition of Hertz vehicles is another big move for its auto sales business. Late in 2024, Amazon struck a deal with Hyundai (005380.KS) to sell new vehicles in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, among others. Amazon users can buy and finance vehicles from local participating dealers directly on Amazon's website or app.

As for Hertz, the company is coming off something of a PR hit after its newly implemented AI scanning tool for returned vehicles dinged renters with high fees, sometimes thousands of dollars, for damage that renters claim they did not incur.",2025-08-20,0.9678,Positive,"['HTZ', 'AMZN', 'KS', 'PR', 'AI']"
Target plunges 10% premarket as EPS falls 20% to $2.05 and comparable sales drop 1.9%,1mvcm1f,callsonreddit,2025-08-20 11:51:40,661,0.98,261,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mvcm1f/target_plunges_10_premarket_as_eps_falls_20_to/,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-beat-low-earnings-expectations-as-shares-plunge-103016404.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-beat-low-earnings-expectations-as-shares-plunge-103016404.html)

Target (TGT) continues to miss the mark on earnings day.

The results on Wednesday morning aren't as shockingly bad as the first quarter, but the retailer is still struggling to find its place in the new economic norm of more discerning shoppers.

Target's second quarter earnings narrowly surpassed consensus forecasts as it wrung out cost savings. The company also maintained the full-year outlook it slashed three months ago.

But headwinds from a pressured US consumer, an influx of tariffs from the Trump administration, market-share loss to rival Walmart (WMT), and operational challenges were apparent.

Target's comparable sales fell 1.9% from a year ago, led by a 3.2% drop at its stores. Comparable digital sales increased 4.3%. Gross profit margins declined to 29% from 30% a year ago.

""While we're not pleased with the results, we're encouraged by the improved performance as we go into the third quarter of the year,"" Target chair and CEO Brian Cornell told me by video call.

Prior to earnings day, Target's stock was down 23% in 2025, compared to Walmart's 13% gain. It shed 9% in premarket trading on Wednesday.

Fixing what ails Target is about to be someone else's responsibility.

Target is tapping a homegrown talent as its next CEO at one of the most pivotal moments in the company's 63-year history.

The discounter announced that longtime CEO Cornell's heavily groomed No. 2, Michael Fiddelke, will take over as CEO on Feb. 1, 2026. Cornell, who has been CEO of Target since August 2014, will slide into the executive chair position for an undetermined period of time. Fiddelke joined Target in 2003 as an intern and rose through the ranks to CFO and then COO.

EDIT : Forgot to mention that options are dirt cheap.  
EDIT 2 : Just to make it clear, the title is about that guy who invested a ridiculous amount of grandmas inheritance money  into Intel and lost like 10% instantly.

I'd like to start this post by saying I used to trade forex using supply/demand and Wyckoff strategy.  
Some of the reasons why I say I used to trade forex are your usual revenge trading, dropping strategy rules just to open a trade due to being impatient etc.  
All those mental challenges coupled with high leverage never turns out well.  
One thing I took out of that experience was definitely a strategy or two that I realised are worth gold while looking at stock price charts.  
Recently I managed to catch Roblox on a run up based on supply/demand strategy and I made couple of thousand % using options.  
All that being said,I believe I have the next big play.  
I want to start by saying that there are few reasons why I believe this is a high conviction play.

I base my opinion on technical and fundamental analysis.

Technical one goes as follows:

The higher time frame, the higher the conviction seems to be the case for the strategies I'm using  
I see a pattern of ""Wyckoff"" in particular : Accumulation being formed on the highest timeframe I've seen so far.  
I don't want to go too deep into what Wyckoff is: There is plenty of info here [https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.wyckoffanalytics.com/wyckoff-method/)  
You can briefly get the idea from the picture.  
Highly skilled traders can have a win rate using Wyckoff of upto 70% which is just crazy.

Fundamental :

There are few reasons as to why I believe Intel is going to see some green days;  
First being interest rates coming down as projected by few investment banks.  
Second being that Intel is being crushed by competitors and have unsuccessfully been playing catch-up game with them.  
The next chip ( Panther Lake) launch window is just around the corner (Late 2025 to early 2026).

Intel is trying to compete with TSMC by offering foundry services on its advanced 18A and 14A nodes.

If a major customer (e.g., Apple, Qualcomm, or even NVIDIA) commits to Intel Foundry, the stock could re-rate sharply

Japans SoftBank Group invested 2 billion into Intel.  
US Government is exploring an option of investing 2.2billion aswell.

I believe that Intel will reach 50 dollars no later then their 1st quarter 2026 earnings.

I'm going full Diamond Hands with this idea by buying these options.

Wish me luck because this pulling through would earn me part of the money I would buy my first property with.

Not a financial advice.

MIT report: 95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing to deliver revenue impact,1muwlbs,callsonreddit,2025-08-19 22:03:29,1523,0.97,231,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1muwlbs/mit_report_95_of_generative_ai_pilots_at/,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mit-report-95-generative-ai-105412686.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mit-report-95-generative-ai-105412686.html)

Good morning. Companies are betting on AI—yet nearly all enterprise pilots are stuck at the starting line.

*The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, a new report published by MIT’s NANDA initiative, reveals that while generative AI holds promise for enterprises, most initiatives to drive rapid revenue growth are falling flat.*  
  
Despite the rush to integrate powerful new models, about 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration; the vast majority stall, delivering little to no measurable impact on P&L. The research—based on 150 interviews with leaders, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments—paints a clear divide between success stories and stalled projects.  
  
To unpack these findings, I spoke with Aditya Challapally, the lead author of the report, and a research contributor to project NANDA at MIT.  
  
“Some large companies’ pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,” Challapally said. Startups led by 19- or 20-year-olds, for example, “have seen revenues jump from zero to $20 million in a year,” he said. “It’s because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools,” he added.  
  
But for 95% of companies in the dataset, generative AI implementation is falling short. The core issue? Not the quality of the AI models, but the “learning gap” for both tools and organizations. While executives often blame regulation or model performance, MIT’s research points to flawed enterprise integration. Generic tools like ChatGPT excel for individuals because of their flexibility, but they stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows, Challapally explained.  
  
The data also reveals a misalignment in resource allocation. More than half of generative AI budgets are devoted to sales and marketing tools, yet MIT found the biggest ROI in back-office automation—eliminating business process outsourcing, cutting external agency costs, and streamlining operations.

# What’s behind successful AI deployments?

How companies adopt AI is crucial. Purchasing AI tools from specialized vendors and building partnerships succeed about 67% of the time, while internal builds succeed only one-third as often.  
  
This finding is particularly relevant in financial services and other highly regulated sectors, where many firms are building their own proprietary generative AI systems in 2025. Yet, MIT’s research suggests companies see far more failures when going solo.  
  
Companies surveyed were often hesitant to share failure rates, Challapally noted. “Almost everywhere we went, enterprises were trying to build their own tool,” he said, but the data showed purchased solutions delivered more reliable results.  
  
Other key factors for success include empowering line managers—not just central AI labs—to drive adoption, and selecting tools that can integrate deeply and adapt over time.  
  
Workforce disruption is already underway, especially in customer support and administrative roles. Rather than mass layoffs, companies are increasingly not backfilling positions as they become vacant. Most changes are concentrated in jobs previously outsourced due to their perceived low value.  
  
The report also highlights the widespread use of “shadow AI”—unsanctioned tools like ChatGPT—and the ongoing challenge of measuring AI’s impact on productivity and profit.  
  
Looking ahead, the most advanced organizations are already experimenting with agentic AI systems that can learn, remember, and act independently within set boundaries—offering a glimpse at how the next phase of enterprise AI might unfold.",2025-08-19,0.9896,Positive,"['AI', 'AI', 'MIT', 'NANDA', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'NANDA', 'MIT', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'MIT', 'AI', 'MIT', 'ROI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'MIT', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI']"

(Reuters) -Palo Alto Networks forecast fiscal 2026 revenue and profit above analysts' estimates on Monday, betting on growing demand for its artificial intelligence-powered cybersecurity solutions, sending its shares up 5% in extended trading.

The company has been benefiting from an AI-driven upgrade cycle as enterprises accelerate their cloud adoption and modernize security operations amid rising data breach incidents.

A wave of high-profile cyberattacks has hit global companies including Microsoft, UnitedHealth Group, Walt Disney and Oracle, prompting the need for robust security solutions.

Palo Alto's new launches such as cloud security platform 'Cortex Cloud' and security platform to protect AI apps 'Prisma AIRS', together with its planned $25 billion CyberArk acquisition, deepen its cybersecurity offerings.

""The company benefits from both net new AI spending as well as a reallocation from services to products (via automation),"" said Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan.

""We think the CyberArk Software acquisition gets them access to more customers to cross-sell identity over to existing Palo Alto customers and the other way around as well.""

Palo Alto also announced on Monday that founder and Chief Technology Officer Nir Zuk has retired after being with the company for over 20 years. Long-time product leader Lee Klarich has been named as its CTO and board member.

Klarich will also chair the board's security committee in a bid to bolster the company's AI-driven platform strategy.

The company projected annual revenue between $10.48 billion and $10.53 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $10.43 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It expects adjusted profit per share of $3.75 to $3.85, above estimates of $3.67 for the fiscal year.

The company's first-quarter revenue forecast of $2.45 billion to $2.47 billion came in above expectations of $2.43 billion. Its adjusted quarterly earnings per share of 88 cents to 90 cents was also above estimates of 85 cents.

Palo Alto's fourth-quarter revenue grew 16% to $2.54 billion from a year ago. It reported adjusted EPS of 95 cents for the quarter ended July 31, beating estimates of 88 cents.",2025-08-18,0.981,Positive,"['AI', 'AI', 'AIRS', 'AI', 'CTO', 'AI', 'LSEG', 'EPS']"

**TL; DR: PACS up by September 2nd. Buy stonks**

This is a follow up on my first DD on WSB: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gxgg0k/pacs\_a\_potential\_x3\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gxgg0k/pacs_a_potential_x3_bagger/)

If you have bought in at that time you probably must be hating the shit out of me because we got railed pretty hard in terms of options.

**I am still holding**

Fear no more regard because I am here to (hopefully) make your money back and get some tendies while we are it.

**About PACS** (this much haven't changed)  
$PACS - skilled nursing facilities (SNF) assisted living facilities in the USA (in short Nursing home)  
Provides senior care and independent facilities, buy/lease real-estate for health care related properties

Founded in Utah in 2013, IPO in 2024  
Similar company: $ENSG  
Revenue: Coming from leasing facilities and insurance reimbursement based on the number of residents  
Finalized acquisition by taking over operations of Prestige Care’s entire SNF portfolio i.e 56 facilities across 6 states and added 2889 skilled nursing beds

Occupancy rate is still at a pretty high level \~90% in comparison of the 70% for the other players of the sector. The best part? Mature facilities are displaying \~93% occupancy rate. See: [https://skillednursingnews.com/2025/01/average-nursing-home-occupancy-grew-slightly-to-80-5-with-pacs-level-surpassing-industry-norms/?utm\_source=chatgpt.com](https://skillednursingnews.com/2025/01/average-nursing-home-occupancy-grew-slightly-to-80-5-with-pacs-level-surpassing-industry-norms/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given the recent acquisition of some facilities you can expect the occupancy rate to grow more.

**What happened?** Why did the stock got hammered and my previous options railed?

Old Hindenburg research group (**which interestingly enough does not exist anymore?**) made a claim that PACS is inflating their numbers by abusing covid era waiver to make more money as well as misleading investors with wrong CMS ratings.

Recall that the waiver allowed beneficiaries to receive Medicare-covered SNF care without a prior hospital stay of at least three days. It expired with the end of the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) on **May 11, 2023**

Since then PACS went terribly down, way more than I initially expected

They have delayed their earnings multiple times while working in tandem with competent authorities.

Market reaction? PACS growing by 30%.

But the worst is still not over yet, management has to finish the investigation:

\-> signals that management is trying to get the confidence of the investors back

**Management are still getting paid through their vesting schedules, it is in their best interests to not being delisted** (think SMCI)

**And here is the key point: Management has until** **~~Sept 2nd~~** **in order not to be delisted. (EDIT: November 19th)**

The fundamentals are still here, the revenu is still here (although slightly revised).

I am betting that manager would find a way to not be delisted and hence leading to a recovery of the stock to at **least $25.**

🚀📈 DD on $ANF (Abercrombie & Fitch) – Earnings August 27th,1mtxkql,Apprehensive_Ad7610,2025-08-18 20:30:00,30,0.65,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mtxkql/dd_on_anf_abercrombie_fitch_earnings_august_27th/,"# 📊 The Setup

Abercrombie & Fitch ($ANF) has been quietly reinventing itself. Once known as a “mall brand dinosaur,” it’s now a **legit growth story**:

* **Earnings track record:** Beating Wall Street expectations consistently over the past several years.
* **Brand identity:**
   * *Abercrombie*: Geared toward young adults through early 40s with versatile styles (work-to-weekend).
   * *Hollister*: Middle & high school kids craving that California surfer aesthetic.

By splitting its brands, ANF has positioned itself to capture both **Gen Z and Millennials** — and it’s working.

# 🛍️ Boots-on-the-Ground DD (Anecdotes Matter)

I did some field research last week (aka took my little sister shopping). We went to **Hollister at Irvine Spectrum**. Here’s what I saw:

* It was **so packed it looked like Black Friday at Walmart**.
* I asked employees if this was normal — they told me it’s usually busy, but right now traffic is **“extremely busy” because of back-to-school season.**
* Compare this to PacSun, which my sister also likes. But she admitted:“Pacsun has nowhere near the traffic of Hollister. Not even 15%.”
* She also said:“Middle schoolers love Hollister’s California fashion and vibe. Shein can’t copy that. They took out Forever 21, but Hollister feels different.”

That’s **real customer sentiment** from the exact demographic Hollister targets. When actual teenagers are saying Hollister has a vibe that Shein can’t replicate — that’s durable brand equity.

# 📈 Financial Momentum

* **Earnings history:** Multiple beats, margin expansion, and strong comps.
* **Competitive advantage:** While fast-fashion giants eat weaker retailers, ANF is thriving because it’s not just about price — it’s about brand identity.
* **Seasonal tailwind:** Back-to-school traffic is showing up in the numbers, and what I witnessed in-store backs this up.

# 🔮 The Thesis

* **Short-term catalyst:** Earnings August 27th → Back-to-school demand should drive another **beat and raise**.
* **Medium-term strength:** Abercrombie’s rebrand broadens its demographic; Hollister locks in the younger generation.
* **Price target:** I believe ANF can **easily surpass $100** post-earnings if momentum continues.

# 💼 My Position

  
(Yep, I’m in. No paper hands here.)

# 📝 TL;DR

* Abercrombie has been **consistently beating earnings**.
* Hollister is seeing **insane back-to-school traffic**, confirmed by employees & actual teenagers.
* PacSun can’t compete, Shein can’t copy the vibe.
* Earnings August 27th → I’m betting we see **$100+ rocket mode** 🚀.

"$PATH – UiPath: Fighting God, Microsoft, and Your CFO’s Patience",1mtxduz,NYCandrun,2025-08-18 20:23:07,43,0.9,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mtxduz/path_uipath_fighting_god_microsoft_and_your_cfos/,"**UiPath ($PATH)** is the RPA prom queen who decided invoice bots weren’t hot enough, so now she’s trying to become the AI puppetmaster of the enterprise. At \~3–4× ARR (\~3.5× EV/sales), Wall Street is treating her like she’s already washed. Which makes this the weirdest value play in AI: either UiPath actually convinces Fortune 50s it’s the Enterprise Nervous System, or it gets beaten to death in an alley by Microsoft Teams and AWS billing calculators.

# State of Play:

* ARR growth slowed to \~12%. 
* Net retention slipping from 119% to 108%. 
* 10,700+ customers still onboard, dev cult intact. 
* Analysts: “meh.” Ratings in the teens.

**Nobody is pricing in upside. The market’s basically saying: congratulations, you’re just macros in a suit.**

**The Pivot: Enter Maestro. UiPath’s shiny new “agentic orchestration” layer.** The pitch: stop thinking about bots doing tasks; think about UiPath conducting humans, bots, and AI agents like some deranged productivity symphony.

# UiPath's bet, the ai stack of dreams:

* AI Center for MLOps, BYOM, retraining. 
* Prebuilt models for OCR, NER, doc handling. 
* GenAI toys bolted on (doc parsing, LlamaIndex). 
* Governance candy for CFOs and compliance trolls.

**Translation: “Please don’t call us RPA, we’re your brainstem now.”**

# The Competitive Bloodbath:

**These guys at UiPath picked a fight with literally everyone.** 

**Automation Anywhere** – Same deck, slightly different colors.

**Blue Prism** – Still cosplaying as the safest option in town.

**Microsoft** – The real boss fight. Power Automate + Copilot bundled into Office for pennies, and “good enough” steamrolls “best-of-breed” every time.

**Appian** – BPM hipster, selling “process fabric” to execs who like words more than results.

**AWS/GCP** – Don’t even pretend. They’ll give you a bucket of Lego APIs cheaper than UiPath’s premium orchestration babysitting.

UiPath’s only moat? Dev love and breadth. Weakest point? The AI Units tax. CFOs paying for idle GPUs like they’re Pelotons in January.

# Why It Matters:

 **The market’s bifurcating:**

**Integrated all-in-one platforms (UiPath, Automation Anywhere).**

**Composable ecosystems (Microsoft, AWS, GCP, Appian).**

UiPath has to justify its price tag vs. “free with your Microsoft license” or “roll-your-own AWS toolkit.” That’s a suicide mission unless Maestro delivers serious ROI.

# Scenarios: 

* **Bull:** UiPath lands Fortune 50s at scale, ARR re-accelerates, multiple rerates like it’s Red Hat for AI. Stock doubles or triples from optionality alone. 
* **Base:** Keeps enterprises that need orchestration across SAP + Salesforce + legacy + AI. Growth stabilizes mid-single digits. It muddles through. 
* **Bear:** Microsoft bundles Power Automate into everything, AWS/GCP commoditize orchestration, CFOs riot over AI Unit bills. UiPath slides into irrelevance as “expensive macro recorder.”

# Catalysts: 

* Fortune 50 Maestro case studies.
* ARR growth troughs then ticks up.
* Hyperscaler alliance.
* Predictable AI Unit pricing.

# Risks: 

* CFOs mutiny over GPU burn.
* Sales inefficiency grows.
* Microsoft’s distribution crushes them.
* Still seen as “RPA vendor” with delusions of grandeur.

# Bottom Line: 

UiPath is priced like it’s already dead. That’s the margin of safety. At 3–4× ARR, you’re not paying for a win; you’re paying for the chance they survive long enough to prove Maestro is more than a PowerPoint trick. If they pull it off, you get rerating upside. If not, you don’t lose much, because the market never priced in victory anyway.

There is a computing shortage for these AI companies and data centre companies who provide high power computing (hpc) and picking up hype.

They had a 1 billion usd contract with core42 but as of today this has expanded to over 7 billion after fluidstack/google deal (with a market cap stock of 3.9 billion)

Key factors:
The value bit. 
1- 7.7 billion in revenue in 10 years
2- no chance of default with Google backstopping 3.2 billion for 14% of the company, effectively evaluating it at 22.8 billion (6x current price)

Warren Buffett places fresh wager on the housing market - COOP/RKT play,1mtpdl8,Boston-Bets,2025-08-18 15:33:17,0,0.45,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mtpdl8/warren_buffett_places_fresh_wager_on_the_housing/,"[https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/housing-market-warren-buffett-buys-dr-horton-lennar-homebuilder-stocks](https://www.resiclubanalytics.com/p/housing-market-warren-buffett-buys-dr-horton-lennar-homebuilder-stocks)

Details are paywalled, but the basics are that, besides the ""bet"" that Buffet placed on UNH that we're all seeing here on WSB, he \*also\* bought into the anticipated improvement in interest rates and the housing market, buying into two of the biggest homebuilders, Lennar and Dr Horton.

I've placed a $1M ""bet"" that Buffet is correct, and that interest rates and housing are going to improve in '26 and '27, with COOP and RKT. RKT, the #1 mortgage originator in the US, has already bought Redfin (RDFN) and is in the process of finalizing the acquisition (announced earlier this year) of COOP, the #1 mortgage servicer in the US.

COOP shareholders are voting to approve the acquisition early Sept, and it's expected to be finalized in early-mid Q4.

Following a great Q2 earnings call, RKT almost hit $20, and COOP briefly hit $200, climbing 25% each in a couple of weeks. Both have pulled back about 10% off their highs on profit taking (and some uneasiness about the PPI number that came out last week), but the float for both is extremely tight and any demand pushes up prices almost immediately.

WHEN a) the acquisition is finalized in Q4, BEFORE any Rate Cuts, their '26 earnings are anticipated to drive RKT pricing into the mid-20's, based on $2.5B in projected earnings ALONE, and b) the Fed cuts rates, as happened last year around the same time, expect RKT pricing to surge 25-40% depending on the number of rate cuts and their timing (check the charts for what happened, last time the Fed cut rates). 

PS, COOP shareholders get 11 RKT per COOP (plus $2) per COOP share, and at current pricing, COOPs trading at a 6-7% discount to RKT (reflecting the ""uncertainty"", what little there is, that the acquisition hasn't been officially approved yet).

Want to join Buffet in playing the housing market and rate cuts?

GoodRx jumps 34% after deal to sell Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 drugs at $499/month as demand for weight-loss meds surges,1mtn23c,callsonreddit,2025-08-18 14:07:28,306,0.96,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mtn23c/goodrx_jumps_34_after_deal_to_sell_novo_nordisks/,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goodrx-stock-soars-after-striking-deal-to-sell-novo-nordisks-glp-1s-for-499month-130021070.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goodrx-stock-soars-after-striking-deal-to-sell-novo-nordisks-glp-1s-for-499month-130021070.html)

GoodRx (GDRX) is joining in on the GLP-1 action with an announcement on Monday that it will begin selling both of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, at a cash price of $499 per month.

The partnership comes as telehealth and digital health platforms are increasingly viewed as ways to provide greater access to the in-demand products.

GoodRx CEO Wendy Barnes told Yahoo Finance that while the company isn't first out of the gate with the strategy, it believes it's coming in at the right time.

""There's no question we could have tried to do something sooner from a compounded alternative pathway, but we have been very clear in our belief that it needed to be FDA-approved, lawfully approved. It just wasn't a pathway that we were going to support,"" Barnes said.

The announcement sent GoodRx's stock soaring, up about 20% in early trading Monday.

Telehealth platforms like Hims & Hers (HIMS) have recently been under pressure after Novo ended a relationship with them, when Hims refused to stop selling compounded, or copycat versions, of the GLP-1s.

Compounded versions of the popular drugs have been on the market for several years, and were originally allowed by the FDA when Novo Nordisk and competitor Eli Lilly (LLY) were unable to meet the demand of the market for their GLP-1s. With the shortages declared over, the copycats are now illegal, but compounding pharmacies and their sellers claim to be lawfully selling them through a loophole in the law, known as personalized medicine. If a patient is unable to tolerate the side effects of a drug, a compounded version is often used.

""There are very good reasons to use compounded medications, which are clinically appropriate and acceptable. That is not where things sit right in this class of drugs,"" Barnes said.

The sales of the injectables through GoodRx also vary from Eli Lilly's strategy, which has been selling vials of its products on telehealth platforms to reach more patients faster. Vials are easier to produce than the injectable pens, which were a key reason behind the shortage in the past two years.

GoodRx said it has seen surging demand for the GLP-1 products, with 17 million inquiries on its site for the drugs in the past year. That's up 22% from the year prior. The sale of Ozempic through GoodRx marks the first time the diabetes drug is being sold at a cash price, GoodRx said.

GoodRx also sells Eli Lilly's drugs, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound, through its regular pharmacy channels at regular prices.

The announcement comes at a time when Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy is losing market share to Eli Lilly's Zepbound. The latest data, ending Aug. 8, shows weekly prescriptions for Zepbound up 199% year over year, compared to Wegovy's 40% increase, according to IQVIA, an analytics firm that tracks prescriptions in the US.

To address its market share decline, Novo Nordisk has announced several strategies that include digital health. It also partnered with CVS (CVS) to be the preferred GLP-1 drug on CVS Caremark's formulary.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has demanded that drug companies use more direct-to-consumer avenues to sell products at cheaper cash prices to patients.",2025-08-18,0.9221,Positive,"['GDRX', 'GLP', 'NVO', 'GLP', 'CEO', 'FDA', 'HIMS', 'GLP', 'FDA', 'LLY', 'GLP', 'GLP', 'IQVIA', 'US', 'CVS', 'CVS', 'GLP', 'CVS']"

Jane Street barred from Indian markets as regulator freezes $566 million over Nifty 50 manipulation claims,1mt2ekj,theverybigapple,2025-08-17 20:57:02,1242,0.95,123,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/04/indian-regulator-bars-us-trading-firm-jane-street-from-accessing-securities-market.html,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has temporarily barred Jane Street Group from accessing India’s securities market, after it accused the U.S. firm of widespread market manipulation.

According to an interim order posted on the regulator’s website on Thursday, Jane Street’s “entities are restrained from accessing the securities market and are further prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly.”

SEBI also issued an interim order to freeze over 48.4 billion Indian rupees ($566.3 million) from Jane Street in alleged illegal gains. It further stated that banks have been directed to ensure that “no debits are made, without permission of SEBI,” for accounts held by Jane Street’s entities either jointly or individually.

Jane Street disputed the findings of SEBI’s interim order and said it will further engage with the regulator, in response to queries from CNBC. A Jane Street spokesperson added that the firm “is committed to operating in compliance with all regulations in the regions we operate around the world.”

‘Without any plausible economic rationale’

Jane Street allegedly used various strategies to artificially influence India’s benchmark Nifty 50
 index — which tracks the country’s top 50 companies — and profit from significantly larger positions in index options.

According to SEBI’s 105-page interim order, Jane Street would aggressively buy large amounts of stocks and futures that are part of the BANKNIFTY index, which tracks the performance of India’s banking sector, early in the trading day. The quantitative trading firm would then place large bets that the index would decline later in the day.

Jane Street would then sell off the positions it had bought earlier, dragging the index lower and making their earlier bets in the options market far more profitable.

While Jane Street would incur some losses, SEBI contended that it was part of a “deliberate strategy to manipulate indices to the advantage of the trading and positions,” and the losses were offset by the firm’s much larger and profitable options trade.

While these actions were not a breach of any regulation, SEBI said that the “intensity and sheer scale” of their intervention, and the rapid reversal of their trades “without any plausible economic rationale, other than the concurrent activity in and impact on their positions in the BANKNIFTY index options markets,” was manipulative.

Options trader Mayank Bansal noted that Jane Street’s actions had been ongoing since July 2023, and their alleged manipulations were increasing before peaking in 2024.

“As an options trader, I could see the manipulation happening live on the screen, and so could other traders on every expiry day,′ added the president of a UAE-based hedge fund, who declined to disclose the name of his company.

While he lauded SEBI’s actions, Bansal said that the regulator should recover any unlawful gains, and a ban on Jane Street “is the bare minimum.”

Protecting retail investors

SEBI noted that repeated instances of manipulative trading continued on the broader Nifty 50 benchmark even after an “explicit advisory” was issued to the firm in February 2025 by the National Stock Exchange of India.

“Such egregious behaviour, in clear disregard/ defiance of the explicit advisory issued to them by NSE in February 2025, amply demonstrates that unlike the vast majority of Foreign Portfolio Investors and other market participants, [Jane Street] Group is not a good faith actor that can be, or deserves to be, trusted,” the regulator said.

“The integrity of the market, and the faith of millions of small investors and traders, can no longer be held hostage to the machinations of such an untrustworthy actor,” SEBI added.

Deven Choksey, founder and managing director of wealth management firm DRChoksey FinServ, said SEBI’s crackdown on Jane Street sets a “good example.”

“Any player who is abusing the market requires to be shown the discipline. The regulator is doing their job for keeping intact the market integrity,” he told CNBC.

While the execution of trades can be customized based on the needs and profile of the trader, price discovery in the market should be “universal for all,” Choksey added.

Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities, noted that some companies may “get into the market with creative and innovative strategies to exploit investors.” Therefore, SEBI needs “to protect the interests of retail investors,” he added.

Any impact on markets as a result of this decision will be short-term, Bathini said.

SEBI’s move comes as several other global trading firms, from Citadel Securities and IMC Trading to Millennium and Optiver, have been stepping up their presence in India, to ride on its booming derivatives markets, which is the world’s largest by contracts traded.

The Indian regulator had previously expressed concerns over practices such as algorithmic trading, which SEBI said in a September 2024 report allowed proprietary traders and foreign portfolio investors to make 610 billion Indian rupees in profits in FY 2024, while retail investors and other market participants lost the same amount during that period.

1. UPS has joined the exclusive ""7% dividend yield club"" among S&P 500 companies, offering an annual yield around **7.3%**. I believe that there will be more cash flow into the company than people pulling out after the dividend yield. 

2. Corporate insiders Director William R. Johnson purchased 5,000 shares at \~$86.50, while CEO Carol Tomé bought 11,682 shares at \~$85.67. at the current dip. 

3. UPS is enhancing its healthcare logistics capabilities with a **$1.6 billion acquisition** of Canada's Andlauer Healthcare Group. This deal, expected to close in H2 2025

4. UPS is cutting **20,000 jobs** and closing **73 facilities** by mid-2025, targeting $3.5 billion in annual savings. Additionally, UPS is reducing its low-margin Amazon business by 50% by mid-2026, pivoting toward more profitable segments like healthcare logistics and SMB services.

5. Analysts at Bank of America view an end to the three-year “freight recession” in 2025. They anticipate that UPS—through dynamic pricing and rate increases—could benefit from improving freight demand, potentially lifting margins and boosting profitability.

6.

For the last several years of investing, I was always a pretty reasonable investor. I followed trends and memes to a small degree, but mostly invested in relatively safe things and was pretty well diversified. This is reflected in my growth from August up until around December.

In December, I started doing dumb shit like going full port in random stocks. And for a while, it was a quick in and out and it obviously was working quite well for me. Did this on stocks like archer, rocket labs, d wave, qubt, and a couple others riding the hype. Then, I found a battery/btc stock, before it seemed to be popular or have much attention, but I felt like it would soon catch on. 

I was able to profit about $110k off the hype, which is how I got to the peak of 726k. However, my next play went terribly wrong.

Around this time, I unfortunately found the pennystock sub — worst thing that could have ever happened to me (so far). Due to my gains on things like archer and others, I gained a small following and several connections. 

Someone reached out to me about a pennystock that seemed to moon often around December. I did a lot of research, I became a mod for the sub, and I truly believed in the company and everything I saw. Given the small market cap I can’t discuss it, but it’s an AI company associated with train safety. 

Unfortunately, I was either extremely wrong or just way too early. Said stock is down 82%, year a date, and quite linearly at that. Due to my research and conviction, and possibly a component of groupthink and being in an echo chamber…. I kept holding and holding, as I began to lose tens of thousands of dollars on a weekly and sometimes daily basis. I was convinced that things would turn around the next week… the next week… the next week. Sadly, the *next* week never came. 

As you can see, I slowly, but quickly, dropped from a high of about $726k to $135k in a span of about 3 months. And yes, I’m just a normal person, so this was devastating for me just like it would be devastating for most people here. It was very hard to cope with and accept at times. But of course, I accept full responsibility for what I did… like a true regard, I made extremely risky and greedy bets, and it worked — until it didn’t. 

Needless to say, I learnt my lesson and these days I never go full port into a single stock anymore, and I sure don’t touch speculative or pennystocks with extremely small market caps anymore where just my personal buying or selling can swing the stock. I’ve made progress on the way back, but still barely half way back to where I was. 

Btw for privacy reasons, I had to change my account to private, so that’s why you won’t see any of my history if you look it up. 

Yes, it takes a true regard to lose $600k in 3 months on a train pennystock. Hope it was a fun read and you guys can learn from my mistakes! ",2025-08-17,0.9843,Positive,['AI']

"Sam Altman says ‘yes,’ AI is in a bubble",1msanvd,usrnmz,2025-08-16 22:59:40,1007,0.95,211,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1msanvd/sam_altman_says_yes_ai_is_in_a_bubble/,"As economists [speculate](https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/ai-bubble-vs-dot-com-stocks-apollo-economist-torsten-slok/) whether the stock market is in an AI bubble that could soon burst, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has just admitted to believing we’re in one. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during [a lengthy interview with *The Verge* and other reporters last night](https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview). “My opinion is yes.”

In the far-ranging interview, Altman compared the market’s reaction to AI to the dot-com bubble in the ’90s, when the value of internet startups soared before crashing down in 2000. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Altman said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited.”

He added that he thinks it’s “insane” that some AI startups with “three people and an idea” are receiving funding at such high valuations. “That’s not rational behavior,” Altman said. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think.” Over the past year, we’ve seen several AI startups, including [Safe Superintelligence](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/12/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskevers-safe-superintelligence-reportedly-valued-at-32b/), led by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, [and Thinking Machines](https://www.reuters.com/technology/mira-muratis-ai-startup-thinking-machines-raises-2-billion-a16z-led-round-2025-07-15/), founded by ex-OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, [raise billions of dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/10/ai-artificial-intelligence-billionaires-wealth.html).

“Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money. We don’t know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money,” Altman said. “My personal belief, although I may turn out to be wrong, is that, on the whole, this would be a huge net win for the economy.”

Even if we may be in an AI bubble, it seems Altman is expecting OpenAI to survive the burst. “You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,” Altman said. “You should expect a bunch of economists to wring their hands.”

I hate the stock but I bought calls - GEO bull case,1ms8wtu,uEIGHTit,2025-08-16 21:50:27,67,0.75,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ms8wtu/i_hate_the_stock_but_i_bought_calls_geo_bull_case/,"I checked WSB for any recent posts on GEO and didn’t find any. So obviously I must be related to Michael Burry or just hide my down syndrome by borrowing a chromie from AI. My assessment has led me to believe it is oversold and undervalued.  
  
Quick background: GEO had a surge in November 2024 with the prospect of Trump cracking down on crime and promising to conduct the largest amount of deportations as we have never seen before. Said we'd never believe it and thanked us for our attention on the matter.

Why did so many people believe it? Well, this is a very large private prison company. Pam Bondi had previously lobbied for GEO and the biggest source of revenue for GEO comes from contracts with ICE. On top of that, Trump rescinded the ban on federal private prison contracts in January 2025.  
  
Then what happened?

By May the administration’s goal of at least 3,000 daily arrests was missed by about 66%. Essentially there were too many big promises made and the whole country was undoubtedly seeing underwhelming performance. It was clear we were not going to see millions of violent illegal aliens rounded up.  
  
The Q1 earnings report in May showed earnings per share at $0.14 missing expectations of $0.19 (revenue $604.6 million, marking a marginal decrease from $605.7 million in Q1 2024.) Net income attributable to GEO dropped to $19.6 million from $22.7 million the previous year, and adjusted EBITDA fell to $99.8 million from $117.6 million.  
  
To this day the Bureau of Prisons has not indicated they will be making new contracts for private prisons beyond the current use of some halfway houses operated by private prisons. We also began sending deportations to El Salvador and then Alligator Alcatraz went live in July.

Earlier this month the Q2 earnings did beat expectations though. The company reported revenues of $636.2 million and net income of $29.1 million ($0.21 per diluted share), which beat analyst estimates of $0.17 EPS and revenue expectations of around $608 million. Also announced was the board’s approval for a $300 million share buyback program. That’s roughly 10% of the current market cap nearing 3 billion at the moment.

GEO proceeded to continue selling off anyways. Why did I say this is a bull case?

You’re welcome for me bringing this up while GEO is on a major downtrend and looks like it wants to delist. You can lose money with me by buying low and selling lower. Obviously I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. If you look further back in history you will see that GEO’s peak occurred near the beginning of Trump’s first term and proceeded to just try to dig a hole to China until the end of his presidency. 

Since this is WSB, I will provide the rest of my musings where I clearly have not fact checked the AI sources. With chronic overcrowding of local jails in major cities across the country I think Trump’s latest escapades with Los Angeles, DC, and soon to be other places that provide an excuse will put pressure on the BOP to once again contract private prisons. Recent events and signaling from the White House has convinced me that GEO has not seen the peak of benefiting from this administration yet.

Anyone pay any attention to why the newly appointed IRS commissioner was removed the other week? He stood his ground on not wanting to provide tax data to Homeland Security (to help identify more people to deport.) So if your tio pays taxes but is illegal himself that’s no bueno for him.

Grok has informed me 90% of immigration related detainees go through private prisons. That sounds like a lot but okay. There is no reason for this administration to tamper down on ICE raids - you can get a 50,000 sign on bonus and your student loans waived if you join the force yourself!

We can't rely on TSMC if something happens to Taiwan.  Though TSMC US plants are making good progress.  
  
DoD this years has already invested in MP Materials, for domestic rare earth mining and processing.   For the same reason they will invest in advanced chip manufacturing.  
*The U.S. Department of Defense now classifies advanced chip production as ""critical infrastructure.""*  
  
Intel has had to delay building more advanced fabs due to funding issues.  The DoD can see that adding money here could be really good for advanced domestic chip production.

The cost to import chips produced abroad could be subject to tariffs.

Trump has talked about building a sovereign wealth fund, and has said in the past we should have taken a stake while doing bailouts rather than just getting paid back via loans.

Position:  
35 price target 6 month calls - modest % of portfolio

  
Here's ChatGPT's take on my argument:

  
Thesis

Intel is the **only U.S.-owned firm pursuing leading-edge logic foundry on U.S. soil**. A strategic equity stake would extend the existing policy toolkit (CHIPS grants/loans, “Secure Enclave” procurement) to secure domestic capacity at advanced nodes, reduce Taiwan exposure, and align incentives for private capital and customers.

# Strategic rationale (condensed)

* **Unique role:** Intel is the **sole American company** attempting cutting-edge logic foundry domestically (18A → 14A), with U.S.-based R&D and wafer production. That’s Intel’s and third-party assessments, and it’s the crux of the national-security argument.
* **Critical infrastructure framing:** Semiconductor manufacturing sits inside DHS/CISA’s **Critical Manufacturing Sector** and the National Critical Functions framework—formal grounds for extraordinary support.
* **Taiwan exposure, partial mitigation:** Any Taiwan shock imperils access to top-end logic. **TSMC Arizona** helps, but Fab 2 N3 **targets 2028** and N2/A16 arrive **late decade**; that’s not a complete hedge today.
* **Policy precedent (blueprint):** In **July 2025**, DoD agreed to buy **$400M** of **convertible preferred** in **MP Materials** plus a **warrant** (≈**15%** as-converted/as-exercised), then **August 2025** added a **$150M OSC loan**—a public-private package to onshore a choke point. That’s the closest analogue to an Intel equity leg.
* **Existing Intel funding (stack to build on):** Commerce awarded Intel **up to $7.865B** in CHIPS **direct funding** (plus eligibility for loans) across AZ/NM/OH/OR, and **up to $3B** for the DoD/Commerce **Secure Enclave** to expand trusted leading-edge manufacturing for government. Equity would better align upside/downside with taxpayers and help de-risk customer onboarding.
* **Execution/funding gap:** Intel has **pushed Ohio** first-fab production into **2030–2031**; equity/offtake can stabilize capex cadence and accelerate schedule confidence.
* **Trade lever (demand shaper):** The administration is **floating large semiconductor tariffs**—recent on-record signals cite **up to 300%**—with exemptions for U.S. production. Tariffs + procurement + equity is a classic triad to pull volume onshore.

# Anticipating pushback (answer in one line)

* **“Just use TSMC Arizona.”** It ramps in stages (N4 in Q4’24; N3 **2028**; N2/A16 **late decade**). Policy needs **redundant, U.S.-owned** leading-edge capacity now.
* **“Intel’s problem is tech, not money.”** True that technology is the long pole; equity doesn’t fix process gaps—but it **keeps the option alive**, anchors customers via offtake/price frameworks, and protects prior CHIPS outlays while engineering catches up. (That’s precisely how DoD structured MP Materials.)

# Timeline callout (policy & industry milestones)

* **Mar 20, 2024** — Commerce announces proposed CHIPS funding to Intel (later finalized).
* **Sep 16, 2024** — **Secure Enclave**: up to **$3B** for trusted, leading-edge government chips (DoD/Commerce).
* **Nov 26, 2024** — Intel **final CHIPS award**: up to **$7.865B** direct funding.
* **Q4 2024 / 2025 updates** — **TSMC Arizona**: N4 HVM **Q4’24**; **N3** targeted **2028**; **N2/A16** **late decade**.
* **Mar 3–4, 2025** — **Intel Ohio** slips to **2030–2031** production timing.
* **Apr 29, 2025** — Intel Foundry update: **18A production U.S.-based** (OR first, AZ ramp), packaging roadmap (Foveros/EMIB).
* **Jul 9–10, 2025** — **DoD ↔ MP Materials**: **$400M** convertible preferred + **warrant** (≈**15%** potential), policy template for strategic equity.
* **Aug 2025** — DoD **OSC** executes **$150M loan** to MP for heavy REE separation.
* **Aug 15, 2025** — Admin **floats tariffs up to 300%** on semiconductors; **stake talks** in Intel surface in major outlets.

(Bloomberg) -- Applied Materials Inc. suffered the worst single-day stock decline in five years after giving a disappointing sales and profit forecast, renewing concerns that the US trade dispute with China is weighing on demand.

Revenue will be approximately $6.7 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts had estimated $7.32 billion on average. Profit will be about $2.11 a share, excluding some items, compared with a projection of $2.38.

Applied Materials, the largest American producer of chipmaking gear, is seeing less demand from customers in China, Chief Executive Officer Gary Dickerson said in an interview. It also faces delays in approval for exporting technology to that country, he said. Moreover, large customers are putting off some purchases in the face of prolonged negotiations around tariffs and other economic issues.

“It just creates a level of uncertainty,” Dickerson said.

The outlook sent shares of Applied Materials down 14% on Friday, the most since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020. They had been up 16% this year heading into the report.

In the third quarter, which ended July 27, revenue rose 7.7% to $7.3 billion. Analysts had anticipated $7.21 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit was $2.48 a share, compared with an estimate of $2.36.

Applied Materials’ customer ranks include some of the biggest names in the chip industry, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. Those manufacturers order gear well ahead of starting production, making Applied Materials’ forecasts a barometer for future demand.

The company said last week that it would participate in an Apple Inc. plan to boost manufacturing in the US by spending more than $200 million on a facility in Arizona. Applied Materials will also sell equipment to Texas Instruments Inc.’s US factories to support Apple products.

“Applied Materials’ decision to be a core member of Apple’s ‘American Manufacturing Program,’ a drive to increase factory production within the US, could strengthen its position as a key supplier of chipmaking tools for advanced semiconductors used in iPhones,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi said in a note.

“The new administration is very focused on increasing semiconductor supply in the United States,” Dickerson said on Thursday. “We’re very positive.”

In July, rival Lam Research Corp. said revenue for the quarter ending in December would ease from the current-quarter levels, with Chinese customers potentially scaling back after a spending spree.

In a further sign of US-China tensions, Applied Materials was recently sued by Beijing E-Town Semiconductor Technology Co. over what that company characterized as trade secret theft.

Still, Dickerson said the long-term demand outlook for computing power remains strong. Customers in China had significantly ramped up buying in recent years, and are now just digesting those purchases, he said.",2025-08-16,0.9771,Positive,"['US', 'US', 'US', 'US', 'US']"

It was just a matter of time before it rebounded, let’s be real, this giant isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. 

I really wanted to enter when the monthly RSI bounced off of 30 at the end of July, but missed an opportunity. Or so I thought. The weekly RSI started rebounding at the beginning of August, along with the daily, and as soon as it crossed over 30 - time to go. 

Started a small position on Aug 5th, 11:25 am (est) - 
The stock popped right at open, for no real reason, other than some buy reiterations from hedge funds and a few articles from SA and the fool. So I watched for a bullish crossover on the 15 minute macd for a point of entry. Bought 290c for 8/15 at .34- 290 being the last gap on the daily. 8/15 because 13Fs were due. 

UNH continued above $250, $255.49 to be exact and retraced from there back to 239.50. Fib retracement here. It opened at the 38.2 fib and held on 8/8, so I scaled in a little more at open. 10 0 DTE 250s for .22, sold 5 at .50, 1 at 1.04, and 4 at 1.08. 

Still holding the 290 at this point, probably down, who knows. 

on 8/11 and opened a 300c 8/22 position at .32. $250 had held through open, still playing the 290 gap/volatility. No idea about buffet at the point. Just had some left over from an intel play that turned out to fuel this. 

Bought intel on 8/11 and sold for 100%+ on 8/13. 

8/14 bought UNH 8/29 300c 5 at 1.36 and a 285c for today at .33 after it hit my 269.xx entry. It hit the 78.6 fib level in AH on 8/13, so my thought was to buy at the next level down if given the opportunity. 

Cue the 13Fs

Exited the 285c and 295c expiring today fairly early on to secure profits. Sold the 285c for 20.00 and the 290 for 15.00. Put limits in before open and left it so I wasn’t going insane. 

Wanted to exit the 300s today, but chose not to, as it has essentially established 305 as a new support level. 

Target exit is 325, right below the gap of 328. 


Currently up 2884% on 8/22 300c and 789% on the 8/29 300cs

Total gain today was $9,500 on a sub $1,000 option strat.

I have been lucky to work in two jobs and already put back $35K back from this loss, it will take me two years to do so and I am already turning 50 years old next year.

I know that there are plenty of opportunities out there such as UNH, Intel or the Solar stocks today, but it just seems not to be for me…

I will keep grinding it pay check by pay check and trying to gradually forget it…. Too many wrong positions to tell some wrong revenge trades.. all sorts of things that you guys can imagine…. After the big loss of $85K I tried to come back with $10K in the 2024 Q4 went all in on Tech earnings (Meta, Amazon, Apple) but was not the right timing ….

I wish you all make tendies and find the hidden 10 baggers but please be careful to not incur in such big losses like I did. The sensation of lost time is very painful to manage.

This is a very small percentage of my port. I do not suggest YOLOing heavy on a brand new company that has never done earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/9lw6hmbs88jf1.png?width=262&format=png&auto=webp&s=6413158789a456a753553f31cfb45b39b939abec

**MKT Cap:** $681M

**Type:** AI chip company based in Austin TX

Context: I work at a FAANG cloud provider that deals w/ these guys. It's the only reason I heard about them. Please do not take that as an insider guaranteed home run because if it was I would have gone heavier and not posted here. 

Theme #1: power bottleneck

I sit next to a data center OG who keeps telling me power is their big bottleneck. There's not enough power to heat and cool these racks due to AI demand.

Theme #2: wearables

I want AI wearables so I’m not always pulling out my phone when I need to ask it about something I'm looking at. Problem is battery drain. You need to run the models locally so they aren't dependent upon the internet at all times (i.e., locally = on the device itself). But AI is a battery life destroyer because the current chips can't do it well. Today most AI features on wearables are just cloud calls. It's slow, requires constant connectivity, and murders your battery.

Ambiq solves this combined problem with ultra-low-power chips built on sub-threshold voltage tech. These are already shipping in devices (a big requirement for me). I was worried this could be copied easily, but they've built a sticky moat to go along with it. They provide own AI runtime/compiler (Helios) optimized for their chips. Once a manufacturer integrates with it, its hard to swap. Company was founded in 2010 so it's not brand new, just small. They are a US based company (pro, under this admin) but have manufacturing set up in a bunch of diff countries (wildcard under this admin).

**Team (important):** I stalk the team on something like this when there's limited data

Founder - Got his PHD in this and started this company so it's his baby. He's a nerd but comes across as a jock. I like that vibe. Unique in this space. I give his stage presence an 8/10. I normally don't like to see a PHD running a company but he's from a state school which is a plus over an Ivy League PHD, IMO.

CEO - guy is very articulate and is good at describing the product without sounding like a snake oil salesmen. I give his stage presence a 7/10.

Engineering team - a lot of nerds who just live to work and have zero hobbies. I like to see this.

Customers: they have a widely-applicable use case and sell to Google, but I couldn't find numbers on that spend. They have some unique value props in healthcare AI. Healthcare is getting destroyed right now and as that sector rebounds I think they will spend even more on AI related things.

**RISKS:**

**-** Brand new stock that IPO'd not long ago. I'm buying post IPO cool-down here. They have never had an earnings.

\- Wearables could stall in general. But as the big guys keep trying this, I think AI wearables are inevitable. I also WANT them personally.

\- No analyst coverage. I had to do my own digging to learn anything about these guys. I even stalked them using some internal company things.

\- 9/4 earnings is a complete crapshoot. This is literally their first one. I dont expect them to be profitable. What I'm looking for is pipeline, guidance and stage presence.

TLDR: this is a speculative bet in an area I am personally familiar with, which is why Im comfortable with the risk. It will be a flier or a complete dog. Do not YOLO into this and come yell at me if you get smoked.

If earnings goes well I'll up the position to $50k (I am risk averse and this is the most I'm comfortable with for this stock). If earnings doesn't go well I'll just hold it as a lottery ticker and add more if I see bullish things.

Thought I'd clue you in early on this one. Redwire has been beaten down from it's \~$25 high and currently sits at \~$8.88 as I write this. This is largely due to their latest earnings report.

**What was so bad about it?**

For starters, EPS was really bad. I almost don't even want to put the numbers because I'm not sure it means anything to most of you... (Est. -$0.04, Actual -$0.41).

Revenue also missed by \~21% YoY. ($61.8M vs $82.8M)

Adjusted EBITA guidance was pulled entirely due to gov contract budget uncertainty.

On the surface I will admit, it looks like the 66% drop from ATH is warranted. In reality though, there is more to unpack here. The situation is actually not as bad as it looks.

**Why is this not a steaming pile of dog shit?**

Let's start with what impacted this quarter so heavily in terms of revenue.

There was a large (favorable) acquisition of Edge Autonomy, which resulted in some additional expenses. Let's take a look at the expenses, and note that these are one-time hits to their expected revenues.

\-29.6M in equity comp

\-16.6M in transaction fees

\-25.2M in EAC revisions

\-20M in interest from seller note repayment

That's about \~90 million of their $97M net losses for the quarter attributed to a deal which is for the most part complete. With these headwinds behind them, the next quarter, unless we see another huge acquisition, will look much different.

Current book to bill ratio is about 1.47, meaning they have more contracts coming in than they can fulfil. This not only lends to the fact that one of the companies strategies is M&A (abundance of contracts means you can acquire places and have work ready for them immediately), but also shows their pipeline is strong, even with guidance suspended.

They are still burning money at the moment, but have $113M in cash still available, with additional credit also available. I don't forsee any liquidity issues.

With a strong pipeline and their biggest headwinds behind them, this will head higher over the next year.

Position: Currently at 2800 shares for \~25.3k (I plan to add more)

TLDR: Space stock has been through the worst of it and the market has overreacted to a not-so-great looking ER. This is a huge growth industry and Redwire is well positioned to take advantage of that with acquisitions and a strong pipeline of work.

Why: $GOOGL $GOOG is arguably one of the best AI companies out there. Google deepmind ( led by demis hasabis) is on par with openai and probably more better. Talent rich, cash rich, growing at scale and expanding.

Moonshots: 
1)Everyone talks about how search will die because of chatGPT etc. No! Earnings for the last 3 quarters have proved re-acceleration in search at almost 11% YoY.

2) YouTube now the most watched form of content. Almost all TV have it and YouTube shorts does 200b of views! Yotube is growing like crazy and content on it is proving to be better then most tv. The new generation will have also grown up on yotube and many have yotube subscription which is also a direct competitor of Spotify- you get free yotube music.

3) GCP - Google cloud. Growing like crazy. Now at $55b run rate. Sundar said they signed more $1B+ deal in the CURRENT quarter, then all of 2024!!! Examples include Salesforce, oracle, OpenAi ( yes them) for compute and GCP. They are growing rapidly due to TPU being super cheap and and cost effective. Constant reinvestment and growth will see them end up with a 100b business in cloud by 2028!!!

4) Gemini - google own LLm. On my benchmarks, this is one of the best models out there. This is being integrated into Google search view Ai overviews + Google ai mode search ( only india and usa have it) try it out. Not only that, they have the best video generation model and world models with Veo 3 & genie 3. Gemini is becoming an enterprise software that many companies are embedding alongside cloud and GCP.

5) stabel growth segments - Google networks are not talked about. Android, play store, Google pixel,  watch and ear phone are in total $50b+ in annual revenue. The upcoming catalyst for this is Pixel 10 release with Google AI embedded in the phone. Google have also entered into the world of VR glasses that will be the most cost effective one. This will be in partnership with eye brand gentle monster who provide hardware for Google software. This will beat Apple ai vision pro and upcoming meta glasses on price point alone.

6) investment - Google are constantly investing into other business and themselves. They have just announced a $9b investment for data centres in Oklahoma. This is in addition to $25b for data centes in usa. They have also announced $6b projection near completion in India- a multi billion industry. They have given all kids in college free google tools and gemini pro to the value of $1B, and have projects going for google fiber for underwater sea cable networks. Rapid expansion across all vertices. They are investing into ai for drug discovery which had began human trials for cancer cures (isomorpic labs) and have constant investments into waymo - which is set to launch outside of USA and begin operations in Japan very soon. A stand alone valuation of waymo is around $150b.

Risk: The doj wants to break up google. They think it's a monopoly. The ruling is due anytime now. Given how unrealistic a break up is likely and could destroy google I don't see it happening. Even the prez of usa himself said he doesn't want them broken up,  he has said google is a innovative American company in tech conference a few weeks ago. I expect some remedial actions out of this which will life alot of risks from google.

Valuation: this is currently trading at cheapest valuation of 20x PE. OR 17x FWD P/E. The next mag 7 close go this is $meta at 29 PE.
A re rating could send $GOOGL on an nvida like run all the way to $280.

The company has not been formally accused of any wrongdoing. Hims & Hers acknowledged last year that it was ""voluntarily cooperating"" with an FTC investigation but has declined to provide specific details about the nature of the inquiry or what information regulators had requested.

After a bunch of research, I decided that, in my regarded, non-expert opinion that you should definitely not follow, that CAT and CSX are the most likely targets, with CAT being most likely. 

Both are stable long term industry businesses that Buffett tends to like. CSX has more downside than CAT but integrates better into his current railway business. CAT has more upside and has stock movement over the past few months similar to Chubb before Buffett announced he was buying them.

I'm investing around $8K in options based on the news today and the fact that I'm not rich or a degen gambler like some of you. I put around $500 each in weekly CAT and CSX calls because I'm a slight gambler. I put around $2K into monthly CSX options and around $5K in monthly CAT options. 

I feel confident that the weekly calls will not print, but they're cheap and sometimes you need to buy a lottery ticket. The CSX monthly calls will likely not print if they are not the acquisition target and I will likely take a small loss on them. CAT I like in general and believe the monthly calls will cover losses on the other options, and will print big if CAT is the target.

1.4m DD GAINZ - $RDDT is still cheap,1mq2eeo,Pleebug,2025-08-14 14:34:21,521,0.9,200,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mq2eeo/14m_dd_gainz_rddt_is_still_cheap/,"**Original DD:**[ 1.3m $RDDT Bet - Too Many Ways to Win](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1l37l3m/13m_rddt_bet_too_many_ways_to_win/)

**Updated timeline:** At current execution pace, I expect $300+ within 6 months. The money machine is hitting on all cylinders, and we're still in the early innings of Reddit's transformation. 

Three months ago, I laid out why RDDT is going higher and we are fucking winning! Congrats to everyone who joined in. As of last Friday, the stock is up 80%+ as management started executing on the points I stated in my last DD. They still haven’t touched the speculative stuff yet and they probably won’t for a few years. ARPU is up 47% yoy and they are just getting started. 

**ARPU**

ARPU increased 47% to $4.53 this quarter. The CFO called this ""still very low"" and he's right. Even reaching half of Meta's $12+ yield would more than double current revenue.

Reddit's new ad products are printing money:

* **Dynamic Product Ads (DPA):** 2x higher ROAS than standard campaigns (basically this means Reddit Ads add lots of value to advertisers compared to other sites) 
* **Reddit Community Intelligence**
   * Advertisers can query the collective knowledge from the billions of human conversations that take place on Reddit. 
   * “An advertiser got an idea on the spot for a potential Super Bowl ad next year,” from Reddit Community Intelligence 
* Reddit hired enterprise sales people to get the word out on these new products.
   * **This resulted in 50%+ growth in active advertisers.**

You obviously use Reddit. Turn off your ad blockers and start paying attention to ad quality and frequency because it is dramatically improving. If you don’t believe me, go see for yourself.

**Management Execution**This quarter proves management can execute flawlessly. Jen Wong that beautiful bastard is at the forefront for the advertiser product suite and is driving ARPU growth of 47%.

Reddit has barely started capitalizing on the potential they have and still have tons of runway with more shopping features, marketplaces, streaming and premium sub-reddits. Premium sub-reddits will be huge, but not as huge as being able to take market share from Google. 

# Improving Search

Reddit wants users to stay. More eyeballs, more money, and this is an easy problem to solve. Reddit's search is so broken that users Google ""question + Reddit"" instead of searching directly on the platform. Reddit is fixing this by combining traditional search with AI-powered answers in one interface. This model is already proven by current AI products and Reddit is perfectly positioned to grab this pie. Instead of external search > quick answer > exit, users will search internally > find answers > discover communities > scroll.

The monetization impact is huge. Every seeker that becomes a scroller drives exponentially higher ARPU through increased ad exposure and deeper engagement. In the age of dying search engines, Reddit is building their own answer engine that keeps users on the platform and decreases their dependence on search engines for growth. 

# Data Moat Monetization

Reddit has publicly announced that AI companies are rock hard for their data and now they have started to protect it. Reddit recently engaged Cloudflare to block AI webcrawlers from scraping. Microsoft already confirmed Bing is blocked while Google continues indexing due to their licensing deal. [https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-confirms-reddit-blocked-bing-search-444385](https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-confirms-reddit-blocked-bing-search-444385)

Earlier this year Reddit sued Anthropic for unauthorized scraping. Regardless of legal outcomes, Reddit forced them to the negotiating table. Most LLMs still source Reddit data without compensation but that's changing fast. As Cloudflare's CEO perfectly stated: ""AI companies understand that original content is fuel for their engines. The assumption that content will be free is ending.""

https://preview.redd.it/ujgewd2quzif1.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=75e8984758601e5d5f2d8cd9d99f484e655fe8e3

Reddit's about to manifest destiny the hell out of AI monetization.

Each of the bots below is another potential contract for Reddit. As Reddit is such a unique and valuable source this gives them much more pricing power than in their previous deals. Now that Reddit’s data is protected, Reddit can receive 10x their current licensing fees. AI companies are extracting billions in value from Reddit's data and soon Reddit will capture their fair share.

# S&P 500 Inclusion

After this last quarter’s earnings report, RDDT is now likely to be added into the S&P 500. QQQ too if RDDT changes its exchange to the NASDAQ. Additionally, the S&P 500 committee will likely find RDDT a compelling addition to the index, as the committee strives to include companies from a diverse range of industries. Reddit is classified under the Internet Content and Information subsector, one of the smallest and least diverse sections of the index; currently there’s only 3 stocks in this sector which makes it the least diverse subsector.

Reddit meets all quantitative criteria and offers the committee exactly what they want, a growing, profitable US company that enhances sector balance while representing emerging economic trends, making Reddit a natural fit for inclusion. 

**Summary**

Management said ARPU growth ""will continue to be a significant opportunity,” and they have proven they can execute on it. With the way management is hustling and executing RDDT still looks cheap.

$UPS - back up the truck,1mpp1lw,Schemesymcplots,2025-08-14 03:06:23,93,0.88,37,https://i.redd.it/2na3ny0oiwif1.jpeg,"UPS DD: Why Papa Buffett’s About to Drop the Bombshell Buy Tomorrow – And Why You Should Load the Truck Before Amazon Tries to Steal Your Tendies! 
Listen up, I’ve got some solid DD on why the Oracle of Omaha, Warren “Infinite Money Glitch” Buffett, has been quietly stacking UPS shares like they’re discounted Cherry Coke at a Berkshire barbecue. 

Word on the street (and in those sneaky 13F filings) is that Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has been building a mystery position in a beaten-down industrial beast, and all signs point to United Parcel Service (UPS). Tomorrow, August 14th, when that Q2 13F drops after the bell, we’re gonna see the big reveal – and if it’s UPS, this bad boy’s gonna moon harder than Elon on a Twitter rant.

Let’s break down why he bought, why it’s bullish AF despite the recent dumpster fire chart, and why those “Amazon’s gonna crush ‘em” doomers can go short their own tendies. Let’s get those gains, fam!

Why Did Grandpa Buffett Buy UPS? ’Cause Value Plays Are His Love Language, not long walks on the beach. 
Buffett doesn’t chase hype like we chase YOLO options on earnings day. Nah, the man’s all about snagging moaty monsters at bargain-bin prices, and UPS is screaming “buy me, daddy!” right now. 

Back in Q1 2025, Berkshire’s 13F showed a sneaky $2 billion jump in the “Commercial, industrial and other” bucket – that’s code for “we’re hiding a gem from you copycat plebs.” 
Analysts are betting it’s UPS, a logistics juggernaut that’s down 30% YTD ‘cause Wall Street’s got the attention span of a goldfish on Adderall. But Buffett? He sees the moat wider than the Mississippi: proprietary networks, brown trucks everywhere, and relationships with every Fortune 500 that’s not named Bezos (more on that later).
UPS trades at a forward P/E of 13x – cheap compared to the S&P’s nosebleed 25x. Throw in a juicy 4.8% dividend yield, and you’ve got a cash cow that prints money while you sleep. Buffett’s been hoarding cash like a doomsday prepper ($277B in reserves last quarter! 3 ), and deploying it into stuff like this is how he turns recessions into retirement funds. Remember when he scooped Chubb in secret? Same playbook here – quiet buys to avoid the herd jacking up the price. UPS fits his vibe: predictable earnings from e-commerce boom, healthcare deliveries (vaccines and pills don’t ship themselves), and global expansion. It’s like BNSF Railway (which Berkshire owns) but for packages – infrastructure that lasts longer than your average 
marriage.

📈 Bullish AF Despite the Downtrend: This Ain’t a Dead Cat Bounce, It’s a Phoenix Rising!
Alright, bears, put down the put options and listen: UPS has been in a downtrend since ‘22 highs, tanking on labor strikes, soft volumes, and “recession fears” that never fully materialized. Chart looks like my portfolio after a bad theta gang week – straight down. But Buffett buys when blood’s in the streets, and here’s why this puppy’s poised to pump:
	•	E-Commerce Tailwinds, Baby! Online shopping ain’t slowing down; it’s exploding. UPS hauled 5.7B packages last year, and with inflation cooling, consumers are back to impulse-buying crap they don’t need. Guidance? 5-7% revenue growth and 10% EPS pop in ‘25. That’s tendie territory. 
	•	Efficiency Gains: Cutting Fat Like a Keto Bro Post-strike, UPS is slashing costs – $1B in savings from automation, EVs, and smarter routes. Margins expanding, free cash flow gushing ($10B+ expected). Buffett loves boring businesses that get better quietly, like a fine wine (or his Cherry Coke addiction).
	•	Diversification Game Strong: Not all eggs in Amazon’s basket. Healthcare logistics? Booming. International? Crushing it in Asia. And that dividend? Hiked 10 years straight – payout ratio under 60%, sustainable as hell.
Despite the dip, fundamentals scream undervalued: EV/EBITDA at 10x vs. historical 12x. 
Market’s pricing in doom, but Buffett’s betting on the rebound.
UPS might be down, but it’s not out – it’s just “parcel-ing” its energy for the upside surge!  

Amazon Won’t Kill UPS – It’ll Just Make It Stronger
Oh, the classic bear thesis: “Amazon’s building its own fleet, UPS is toast! Bezos gonna eat their lunch!” LMAO, sit down, Karen – let’s debunk this faster than a margin call.
	•	Amazon’s Still a Customer, Not a Killer: Yeah, Amazon cut UPS volume by 20% to build in-house, but UPS wants that. Low-margin Amazon hauls were dragging profits; now they’re focusing on high-margin SMBs and healthcare. Amazon’s only 13% of revenue – diversified AF. Plus, Amazon can’t replicate UPS’s global reach overnight; they’re partners, not mortal enemies.
	•	Moat Too Thicc for Bezos: UPS’s network? Unmatched – 220 countries, 500 planes, 120K vehicles. Amazon’s delivery game is US-heavy and loss-making. UPS profits while Amazon subsidizes Prime. Long-term? E-com grows for everyone; UPS wins with efficiency.
	•	History Lesson, Noobs: Remember when everyone said Netflix would kill cable? Or Tesla would bury Ford? Nah, incumbents adapt. UPS is investing $1B in EVs and tech to stay ahead – Buffett’s seen this movie before and bets on the survivor. 

TL;DR – Why You Should Buy In Before Tomorrow’s Reveal
Buffett’s buying UPS ‘cause it’s a value beast with a moat, dividends, and growth – announcing tomorrow in the 13F. Bullish despite dips ’cause fundamentals > charts. Amazon? Overhyped threat; UPS adapts and thrives. Target: $100+ by EOY if reveal pumps it.

PSKY - DD From a Senior Finance Manager,1mp8v11,Quick_Increase6718,2025-08-13 16:16:56,43,0.81,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mp8v11/psky_dd_from_a_senior_finance_manager/,"Long time no see. My failed gamble last year on Carvana puts kept me out of the game but I now see another opportunity in PSKY. 

When I first learned about the Paramount Skydance merger earlier this year (positions included), I went all in. Shares were trading at \~$11 but there was a $15 cash offer when merger completes. Did a bunch of research on Paramount (PARA) and concluded the likelihood merger completes was high 90%+ and even if merger failed to pass FCC regulations, the underlying stock still had Price/Book < 50% so they could sell off all their assets and their stock price theoretically should increase. However, I did not post a DD because I felt bad about my Carvana play.

After the merger was approved, I did a bunch of research with the help of ChatGPT to find out what a fair market price for PSKY was. The way the merger was structured, roughly half your shares would get instantly redeemed for $15 and the other half would convert into shares of PSKY, so it was important to estimate what PSKY would be worth. 

Analysis showed a bear case of $14-18 a share with a bull case at $30-$34 a share based on a multiples approach. 

https://preview.redd.it/mrh4yj028tif1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde16375e1436dd3747dbb13f5c337255f7919cb

I did additional analysis by having ChatGPT run a DCF and got the following $36/share:

https://preview.redd.it/h1vaojdb8tif1.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5472acd30f822baa8174d6ebdd79468a7d984ef

Under both financial methods, the estimated share price is far above the current share price, but financial metrics aren't everything.

In todays environment, politics heavily affect a company's stock value. Without leaning or making arguments to either side, I think we can all agree that being on the current administration's good side is beneficial to any company. As part of the merger approval, Paramount had to pay $16m to Trump to settle a news distortion case. They also canned Stephen Colbert. Additionally, PSKY's current CEO is David Ellison and the Ellison family have been big-time Trump doners/supporters. With Trump bashing Fox News, PSKY positions itself to be the new channel of the right.

Paramount is also making a huge play to get subscribers on their streaming platform Paramount+ with the recent UFC deal. 

One final thought: Warren Buffet invested $2.6B in Paramount mid 2022 when the price was in the high 20s - low 30s. This means that from a value investing and fundamentals perspective, there is value even in that price range. As the price continued to drop and merger talks happened, he exited out of his positions at a loss, possibly because he knew a prolonged merger would put a ceiling on the price for a long time. I sure as hell trust Warren Buffet’s decision to buy a lot more than my own and would be curious to see if he jumps back in the play now that the merger is complete.

**TLDR: Multiple valuation models put PSKY in the $30 range (currently $14). Political environment and streaming environment both currently extremely favorable.**  
**As it stands, PSKY should rocket into the sky! Or at least into the $30 range.**

3000 call options for January 2026 with a 30 USD strike price; you can also see in my previous postings that I hadn’t sold when we were at almost $40 and then when it went all the way down, I added to my Unity position. 

  
**Disclaimer**

This isn’t financial advice. This is all just for your entertainment.

**TLDR of the TLDR**

Unity can do an AppLovin stock move if Unity’s new AI-Powered ad Platform Vector succeeds. So far, Vector has “far exceeded our expectations” according to the CEO Bromberg 1 week ago. My 1 year price target is $200. That would represent around half of AppLovin’s current market cap; their main competitor in the ad space. Unity powers 70% of mobile games with their engine (Unity software is on 2.5 billion devices - you read that right, read it again and maybe one more time. This also includes the China market… ), but until Vector they haven’t really capitalized on this potential moat. In the short-term gamma squeezes and even a short squeeze (9.28% shorted) are possible because various whales are buying OTM call options en masse and up to 88.26% of Unity is institutionally held and most positions have been made when the stock was over $100 (according to Fintel) which creates illiquidity as institutions likely won’t want to sell a turn-around stock in a bull market when they are still in the minus. In other words, if you bet on Unity, you are riding together with the whales. And if you think gaming has a future and ads will play a role, especially on mobile phones and VR (60% of VR games are made with Unity), and you are still here, you might as well read my intro and the TLDR.

**About me**

I went from 27k to 5M+ in less than 2 years (see my previous posts on WSB), but I also lost 180k back in the SPAC days and had to start again from scratch. This taught me that I should only invest in undervalued  companies that have some sort of actual moat. Previously I went with long-term calls into PLTR at around $8 and then into SOFI at around $7 (which btw at that time people also argued were overvalued). Unity is my third and only play. The rest I have in cash. My life hasn’t changed much (only my parents know and 2 friends), but whatever happens, I’ll be able to create an animal shelter for homeless dogs and other animals. 

**TLDR**

Unity is a turn-around, it has almost 0 interest from the retail community (try yourself and search on YouTube or X if anything received lots of interactions in the recent 1-2 years. This is good, because we are so early that no popular finfluencer is covering it), it’s actually even hated among retail because of Unity’s previous management and its runtime fee non-sense. Since their new CEO Bromberg took over 15 months ago, Unity not only reversed the runtime fee decisions, but also double beat on their earnings each time. Last week they did it again and analysts all upgraded Unity stock based on the most recent quarter. Still the stock is beaten down when you look at the 5 year chart (Unity used to trade above $200). I am not a technical trader, but I like beaten down stocks that are in the accumulation zone for years while the underlying company double beats each quarter and keeps growing. I like it even more when we are now witnessing the first great results of an AI product that hasn’t even started yet - Vector. It reminds me of when Palantir introduced their AIP bootcamps, their game changer. Ok, I tricked you. The TLDR of the TLDR and this TLDR are actually just an introduction. You might as well read the rest now. At least try to read the next sentence and see if it gets you hooked for more. 

**AppLovin, Unity’s main competitor**

AppLovin (Ticker APP - check out what their stock did in the last 12 months as inspiration) tried to buy Unity in 2022 for $58.85 per share and Unity rejected because they much rather wanted to compete with AppLovin in ads since Unity has the better moat (they provide the engine on which the games run). Based on some rumors they tried buying them a second time last year. However often AppLovin really tried to buy Unity, I am relieved that I could still invest in Unity. 

**Secret whale(s)**

In the background there’s an investor or multiple investors that have been putting $40M+ in the last few weeks on Unity OTM call options. Whoever that is, they got balls of steel as they are riding all ups and downs like a madman and keep accumulating. Yesterday alone around $10M was added to this Friday’s options chain. If Unity holds above $37.50 until Friday, we might see a gamma squeeze. Also, with up to 90% institutional ownership, where the majority is way underwater, thus likely not selling (which makes the stock illiquid) and Unity being almost 10% shorted, we might see a short squeeze. It’s not my main investment thesis, but definitely fun to watch this unfold. It’s still a big if, so don’t bet on it.      

**Unity and AppLovin experts**

If you don’t believe me because I am just claiming to be a wizard and can’t even write wizard, make sure to invest 3 hours of your time to watch 2 podcasts of the GameMakers (one is from Apr 8, 2025 and the other one is from June 10th, 2025; you can find it on YT) and watch how they are slowly changing their opinion full of skepticism towards Unity’s new Vector platform to seeing some potential opportunity for Unity to then 5 days ago Josh Chandley, Co-Founder at WildCard (mobile) Games, posting this:

And have a look who is liking this. Multiple employees in senior roles at Unity wouldn’t outright confirm any numbers obviously (they like to sandbag and then doublebeat at the earnings). So, feel free to have a look at this LinkedIn posting and check for yourself how many Unity employees liked that posting. It’s around 50+ Unity employees. Here’s one senior employee:

  
[https://ibb.co/0RfpB8YB](https://ibb.co/0RfpB8YB)

  
**Unity partners**

Not surprisingly as the biggest engine provider in the world Unity is partnered with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo, Meta (for the Oculus) and Sony (for the PlayStation), but also with Tencent to help developers bring more games to China. They are also partnered with lots of other companies, even multiple car manufacturers (Mercedes-Benz, Toyota etc.) to create 3D models.

**Macro cycle**

We never know what Trump is up to and if we will get the next recession this year, next year or with the next president. But what we know is that we are at all-time-highs. Typically in all-time-highs the more speculative and smaller cap stocks go up. Unity fundamentally isn’t a highly speculative stock, but it is perceived as one. So, even if you think that we will soon have a recession, Unity might as well go up in the short-term. For the intermediate term in case of a recession, millions of people losing their jobs would cause what? 4 years ago when people lost their jobs and were at home they were playing (mobile) games and many programmers also created games. This was the time when Unity stock was above $200. And now with generative AI it will be even easier to create new mobile games. Unity is still the best game engine for new developers. In short, I am not too worried about Unity even if a recession hits anytime soon.  

**Unity red flag:**

Yes, I am honest here. There’s also something critical about Unity. I am fine with stock-based-compensation. That’s normal for such companies to keep talent and attract more talent. But when I read through Glassdoor reviews, Unity employees emphasize the great work-life-balance… Sorry, but if any Unity employees read this: AppLovin has eaten your breakfast, lunch and dinner in the last few years. True, you previously had really bad management. But now with your CEO Bromberg and Vector you have a real chance to eat their dessert. That’s the best food anyway. So, in the next 9-12 months keep pushing like never before to get it! I believe in unity. You have been waiting for this long enough.   ",2025-08-13,0.9986,Positive,"['USD', 'TLDR', 'TLDR', 'AI', 'CEO', 'OTM', 'VR', 'VR', 'TLDR', 'WSB', 'SPAC', 'PLTR', 'SOFI', 'TLDR', 'CEO', 'AI', 'AIP', 'TLDR', 'TLDR', 'TLDR', 'APP', 'OTM', 'YT', 'BB', 'BC', 'BF', 'BC', 'BD', 'BD', 'BB', 'BC', 'BF', 'BC', 'BD', 'BD', 'AI', 'CEO']"

Need more? COD is dead and buried. People are tired of Fortnite skins and are ready to get back to the brutal warfare and ptsd triggering gameplay that helps me relate to my grandpa. 

I know what you are thinking. “Mason the stock is up 20 percent this month and hit an all time high today. It’s clearly priced in.” 

Well I haven’t played a video game in 4 years and I’m eager for this release. I also do not know how to pre order. That means I have clearly not been priced in. Pair that with EAs terrible track record it’s not far fetched to think a lot of people are apprehensive to pre order this game but will fomo in on release.

 Even with all that it still managed a staggering 600k pre orders and 2.7M wishlist on steam.

The program bypasses traditional Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval in favor of DOE’s own streamlined authorization process under the Atomic Energy Act, enabling participants to move from design to criticality in record time.

**Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO)** secured **two projects** in the program, while its subsidiary **Atomic Alchemy Inc.** earned a third selection. Another high-profile winner was **Terrestrial Energy Inc.**, developer of the Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR), whose inclusion in the pilot program could accelerate its path to commercial deployment.

For investors, Terrestrial Energy is currently accessible through its merger partner **HCM II Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: HOND)**, a publicly traded SPAC. Once the business combination closes—expected later in 2025—the combined company plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker **IMSR**.

The DOE’s announcement is part of a broader federal push to revitalize nuclear technology, seen as essential for powering AI infrastructure, data centers, and national security facilities. With ambitious deadlines and unprecedented regulatory speed, the program signals a new era of competition in advanced nuclear—and offers public-market exposure through companies like Oklo and the HOND-to-IMSR pipeline.

I went full degenerate on my own account after seeing the partnership NBIS had with NVIDIA all those months back and never looked back. For my parents accounts I played it more conservatively and put 20% and 50% of their portfolios respectively into NBIS, I’m not fully stupid unfortunately  

My individual account and my mom’s retirement accounts kind of just look like the NVIDIA graph, and when I saw the partnership, I was like, wouldn’t it be funny if I could ride the NVIDIA wave twice but sooner? And that’s exactly what I did (for now) 

My mother has been a cashier her entire life making around 28k a year (and also how I became a cashier to put money into my Roth in the first place, I love indirect nepotism) and my father owns a small optical shop since the end of Covid, so most of his investment is reinvesting into his store.

(Reuters) -CoreWeave topped Wall Street estimates for second-quarter revenue on Tuesday, driven by accelerating demand for the Nvidia-backed AI cloud computing firm's services.

The company offers access to data centers and Nvidia chips, which are highly coveted for by enterprises to train and run large AI models amid intense competition.

CoreWeave, which currently has 33 AI data centers up and running across the U.S. and Europe, focuses solely on GPU-based operations.

The company's operating expenses jumped to $1.19 billion in the quarter, compared to $317.7 million a year.

Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave's shares fell 6% in trading after the bell. The stock has gained nearly three-fold since its March IPO.

Revenue backlog was $30.1 billion as of June 30, the company said.

0 to 265k in 2 years on a 100k/yr salary (VHCOL),1mo0hms,bangaverage99,2025-08-12 05:43:16,93,0.64,92,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mo0hms,"25M went from 0 to 265k in exactly 2 years (just completed my 2 year anniversary at work this past week), from my first job straight out of college. I make 100k a year before taxes and live in a VHCOL place. I max out my Roth IRA, 401k and HSA every year expecting long term tax free gains. I transfer all of the money that’s left after paying out my credit cards and rent over to my individual brokerage account. I generally have a high risk appetite but stick to stocks and limit myself to mutual funds or ETFs in my retirement accounts. 

I take home around $6,150 a month after taxes. After deducting my 401k and HSA contributions it’s comes to around $4,000. I keep my living expenses as low as possible (roughly $1,200) since my primary goal is to pile up as much money into my investment accounts as early as possible, so I can relax and spend a little more once I have a family and dependents to care for. Having said that, I try to not let it compromise my lifestyle or take away the things I like doing the most. I travel and go on low-cost budget trips at least 3 times a year while at least making one international trip. The biggest place where I save on is my rent. I pay at least less than half what most of my other friends pay who live in the same area. I live in a flex room (living room converted into a personal spacex/bedroom using curtains/room dividers) in a fancy high rise that has an amazing view overlooking the downtown area and city nearby. This also pushes me to go out of the house more often and explore places around me in the city and meet new people. 

My portfolio consists of mostly Palantir (50%) and some NVIDIA (20%) with some other promising high growth companies. It has returned a staggering 334%. My net worth makes no sense to me given how much I make. I’ve not made anywhere close to what I have now post taxes and expenses. Make it make sense to me.

ACHR: Archer Aviation is about to BLOW THE LID OFF and unveil its Anduril partnership with a major upcoming DoD Program of Record,1mnnksm,Xtianus21,2025-08-11 20:04:56,17,0.53,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mnnksm/achr_archer_aviation_is_about_to_blow_the_lid_off/,"Archer Aviation and Anduril Industries are deliberately positioning a **hybrid-propulsion VTOL** with **AI/autonomy** for a **DoD Program of Record (PoR)**. Lobbying efforts of both Archer Aviation and Anduril show a telling story of how this is all going to unfold:

1. **active U.S. Air Force work under AFWERX/Agility Prime through FY-25**,
2. a **pivot to “Agile Support Prime”** focused on hybrid VTOL,
3. **fresh capital and capability build-ups**, and
4. **lobbying disclosures** that explicitly target **FY-25/FY-26 authorization/appropriations**—including “Hybrid VTOL Aircraft technology development.”

What this essentially is stating is that Anduril and Archer have already begun prototyping efforts for autonomous unmanned hybrid propulsion engine aircraft that will become a congressionally approved Program of Record.

Here is a new update to the [Archer Defense website](https://defense.archer.com/), updated TODAY or very recently, that states:

https://preview.redd.it/wuxabn695gif1.jpg?width=1372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39995880c007d6148e5045b973c2037ab15f19f0

Moreover, with Archer's two recent acquisition i.e. Overair they have received a lobbying agent and a facility that is exactly Anduril's neighborhood. It also hired **Melissa McCaffrey** (formerly of Overair) to handle state and local advocacy [revolution.aero](https://www.revolution.aero/news/2024/04/18/archer-makes-key-appointments-for-new-d-c-office/#:~:text=Current%20Archer%20executive%20and%20Former,joined%20in%20an%20advisory%20capacity).

In August 2025, Archer bought **a composites manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach, CA**, which is in close proximity to **Anduril’s headquarters**.

That facility came from **Mission Critical Composites**, not Fabrica International. Mission Critical Composites specializes in **advanced aerospace composite structures**—perfect for Archer’s hybrid VTOL defense program.

https://preview.redd.it/m6plzwbf5gif1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de1b33e1011c42d41dc356988e95b3ca9c38787d

So as I am tracking this what I am saying in summary. Archer Aviation is using the leftover AFWERX money from Agility Prime for the rest of 2024 - 2025 to begin the Hybrid VTOL aircraft with Anduril and then will transition that into the Agile Support Prime to begin and OTA pre-Program of Record rolled up major DoD program that was approved in the recently passed ""Big Beautiful Bill."" In a year end 2025 award or by early 2026. All the evidence points to this. Because they have been working on this for so long (over a year) and have lobbied for essentially what is being awarded in the bill they could receive an award and funding in a very short amount of time 3 - 7 months by my estimates.

# Why this is real (not just vibes)

# How this likely becomes a PoR (mechanics + timing)

1. **Prototype under OTA (now through early FY-26)**
   * Existing **Agility Prime** funds (FY-25) finish USAF eVTOL evals and **de-risk platform** elements. Archer’s Dec. 2024–2025 moves + LD-2 language suggest **Hybrid VTOL work ramps under the same ecosystem**, then rolls under **Agile Support Prime** as it stands up in FY-26.

2. **Agile Support Prime = the integration wrapper**
   * AFWERX confirmed the **rename/shift**; reporting indicates USAF interest is **hybrid-electric** for **range/payload**. That squarely fits **Archer’s hybrid airframe** \+ **Anduril’s autonomy**. [The Air Current](https://theaircurrent.com/defense/air-force-afwerx-evtol-agility-prime-new-program/)
3. **Transition decision (late FY-26 into FY-27)**
   * With the “**One Big Beautiful Bill**” adding **\~$150B** in defense money overall (with substantial autonomy/UAS emphasis in analyses), Agile Support Prime is a clean on-ramp to **PoR** if demos hit. [Inside Government Contracts](https://www.insidegovernmentcontracts.com/2025/07/one-big-beautiful-bill-act-makes-150b-investment-in-defense/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
   * Several analyses total **“$33B for drones/autonomy/AI”** across the bill’s buckets. Treat this as an **analyst tally**, not a single bill line item.

# What to watch (near-term catalysts)

1. **FY-26 USAF RDT&E justification**: look for **Agile Support Prime** naming and OTA language. [Saffm](https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/Portals/84/documents/FY26/FY26%20Air%20Force%20Research%20and%20Development%20Test%20and%20Evaluation%20Vol%20II.pdf?ver=vrLoWfwr4s9gxxTgIb7qzQ%3D%3D&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **USAF/AFWERX announcements**: a **joint OTA** (Archer airframe + Anduril autonomy) would be the smoking gun. [The Air Current](https://theaircurrent.com/defense/air-force-afwerx-evtol-agility-prime-new-program/)
3. **Contract wires**: additional USAF (or SOCOM/USMC) **prototype task orders** under a Prime/OTA that mention **hybrid VTOL** integration.

# TL;DR (the thesis)

* **They’ve laid the runway** (USAF work, funding, partnership, acquisitions).
* **They’ve marked the route** (LD-2s that literally say **Hybrid VTOL** for **FY-25/FY-26**).
* **The Air Force just put up the sign** (**Agile Support Prime**).
* **Next stop:** a **joint OTA**, then **PoR**—if flight demos and missionization land on value.

You regards keep DCAing at the top… I can’t tell who is more regarded Palantir bulls or Saylor. In any case, I rather bet against the Palantards. 

I took a 50% loss on the previous position. But SPX 0 dte is my piggy bank, and I’ll come out on top no matter how long it takes! 


PLTR is now at 616.6 P/E ratio! Even juicer! I’m long on the market and I cannot find a better hedge than PLTR with this huge R/R ratio. This is the best setup since ZOOM at $500 in 2020. 

Previous post: 

Headline: If you bought a company with this high of a P/E ratio when Columbus discovered America and earnings stayed flat you’d be breaking even about now.

History repeats itself:

EDS in the 1970s was the hot stock trading for a p/e of 500+. The company crashed and later got acquired by HP (what is HP you say? Good question).

About EDS:

Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS) is a recognized leader in the management of information technology. The company designs, installs, and operates data processing systems for customers in the automotive, communications, energy, financial, government, healthcare, insurance, retail distribution, transportation, utilities, and manufacturing industries. An innovator in facilities management, EDS originated the concept of long-term fixed-price contracts for this industry. EDS owns the largest private digital telecommunications network in the world and conducts business in all 50 states and in 27 countries.

Sounds similar?? I think so! However, PLTR is mostly taking money from the government and plugging chatGPT into a UI.

PLTR is now trading at a 575 P/E.

The CEO might be good, but he’s just pumping the stock while selling on retail, and all of you are falling for it. His earnings calls are all about calling out the haters and making 100000x returns. It’s all fugazy.

Regards will leave their bags to their grand grand children in hopes of making a profit.

Remember nana?? That’s your wife’s future in the making while you use the money your wife’s boyfriend gave her to buy PLTR on her Roth IRA.

Loaded on puts and will keep loading more until I’m right and win big.

**Preface**: In recent months Ondas Holdings Incorporated has seen a rapid surge of its share price and market valuations. From a recent low of 69 cents on the 20th of March to almost hitting 4 dollars on Friday, this stock has seen a 414% increase (as per the Friday close of 3.55), however I do believe that ONDS has much much further room to grow, as I will explain in this post. 

# Addressing the Elephant in the room

https://preview.redd.it/cegd00i32eif1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=173a56cc2e2535d0892e50f76bcecbd785a0a39b

A surge of 414% from the absolute lows is a massive increase, and many fellow regards would tell me “Pack it up, it’s already mooned. Another memestock to be rugpulled on lmao” 

I tend to disagree, not only do I disagree with putting ONDS as a memestock, but I also believe that ONDS has not yet begun to showcase just how much they can grow. YES, the share price has soared, but I believe that in the coming months and years we will see the valuation of the company increase further, with incoming government contracts, partnerships and a much stronger balance sheet. 

# Little to no risk of dilution at these prices

* KLEAR: For non-dilutive working capital to fuel growth in defense and drone technologies.  KLEAR serves as Ondas’ preferred working capital finance partner. The collaboration provides non-dilutive financing, meaning it allows Ondas and its affiliated companies to access liquidity without issuing new equity or diluting existing shareholders’ stakes. This is achieved through KLEAR’s embedded capital tools, liquidity planning, and treasury management infrastructure, designed to reduce financial friction for smaller suppliers and technology innovators who often face restricted access to credit markets.

# Strong Balance Sheet

# ONDS Future Plans

* The investment of Rift Dynamics (producer of drones in Norway) and their Wåsp Drone is a crucial and cheap to drone warfare for FPV drones.  Eric Brock, the CEO of Ondas Holdings Inc., is expected to join the Board of Directors of Rift Dynamics AS upon the closing of a strategic investment and partnership agreement between the two companies. The partnership grants Ondas' subsidiary, American Robotics(iron drone), exclusive distribution rights for Rift Dynamics' Wåsp drone platform in the U.S. defense market.  source: [https://www.riftdynamics.io/](https://www.riftdynamics.io/)  
* Optimus System (AI-powered autonomous drone platform) and Iron Drone Raider (counter-drone system), targeting industrial, defense, and homeland security markets. The company plans to increase production to meet a $28.7 million order backlog, including $14.3 million for Optimus Systems and $8.0 million for Iron Drone Raiders.  
* The company is growing its operational footprint in the U.S. and Europe, with additional demonstrations planned in the coming months, and targeting engagements in the Middle East and Asia, including NATO countries and major governmental clients. with successful drone pilot programs in Europe and Asia, particularly for the Iron Drone Raider system, which completed tests in five operational scenarios. The company sees significant opportunities in NATO countries and other regions due to shifting defense spending policies.
* aims to strengthen its presence in defense, homeland security, public safety, and critical infrastructure markets. This includes expanding its Iron Drone Raider system, which has shown success in live combat environments and secured a $3.4 million order in Europe.
* Ondas is committed to advancing its AI-powered drone technologies and private industrial wireless networks. The company aims to lead in drone-as-a-service and counter-UAS (unmanned aerial systems) technologies, capitalizing on rising global demand, particularly in defense and rail communication sectors
* Partnerships with companies like Detroit Manufacturing Systems and Palantir Technologies aim to boost U.S. drone production and integrate AI-powered solutions, respectively. scaling of its autonomous drone platforms, such as the Optimus 1-Ex, which received historic U.S. FAA Type Certification.

# Competitors and future of the Industry

   \-  Skydio and DJI. Both are private companies that make drones and their own software.

   \-  UAVs(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) are a growing industry in modern times especially for modern warfare and defense. Also they’re (wasp) cheap and disposable to use, making for companies to produce them at mass of thousands at the ready to deploy. 

\-  The commercial drone market is on a steep upward trajectory. By 2025, the market is estimated to reach $40.6 billion, surging to $57.8 billion by 2030. Key segments include:

* **Services**: Projected at $29.4 billion by 2025, encompassing flight operations, engineering, training, and consulting.
* **Hardware**: Valued at $6.7 billion by 2025, the fastest-growing segment.
* **Software**: Expected to hit $1.7 billion by 2025.
* Public Safety and Emergency Response: Increased use in border security, disaster management, and firefighting, also U.S. Army exercises and NATO operations.
* **Infrastructure and Inspections**: Autonomous scans using lidar and thermal imaging for energy, construction, and urban planning.
*  Tools for predicting windy urban conditions to support air taxis and crowded skies.
* In August 2025, the FAA proposed a rule to normalize BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line Of Sight) operations, enabling broader uses like package delivery and public safety while enhancing safety.

Buy $TLT just incase market crashes so you don’t blow your account up in a black swan, or if thesis is wrong. 


Trade Setup:
	•	33% Portfolio: AMD calls 12/17/27, $360 strike (111% out of the money as of today)
	•	66% Portfolio: $TLT shares (U.S. Treasury bonds)

$AMD Thesis In A Nutshell:

$NVDA market cap: $4.4T
$AMD market cap: $270B

The world is in a massive race to get more chips, and NVDA looks on track for a $10T market cap.

For the first time starting this quarter, AMD’s MI355X is on par with NVDA, with cheaper chips. Sam Altman promoted the MI400 and MI450 at an AI event earlier this year. Hyperscaler consensus is that they are testing the MI350 this year to get familiar with integrating AMD into their data centers, so they will be ready to place big orders next year for the rack scale MI400 and MI450. This was noted on the most recent earnings call.

From here on, AMD’s chips will be on par, if not better, than NVDA for inference, which both Jensen Huang and Sam Altman agree will grow 1000x+ from current demand levels. Jensen said this on the GP2 podcast interview.

In 2024, AMD did $12B in data center revenue with inferior chips, while NVDA did $115B. If AMD can do $55B in 2027, which is half of NVDA’s 2024 data center revenue, it is easily a $1T company, or an $800 stock.

Everything suggests AMD will have a competitive product at a competitive price point, with demand setting up to be off the charts in 2026 and 2027, similar to NVDA’s neck breaking 2023 and 2024 growth rates of 100%+.

Second Leg Of Trade:

If there is a recession or a black swan event, the Fed will cut rates and send TLT soaring, making up for a $0 AMD option. This is a simple hedge against a Covid style scenario.

Best Case:
	•	TLT gains 50% to 100% from rate cuts on 66% of my portfolio
	•	AMD 4x in 2.5 years from AI chip demand, with calls returning 20x on 33% of my portfolio

Base Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0 if NVDA outcompetes AMD like in past AI failures such as MI300
	•	TLT rises as rates come down, which recovers the call premiums and results in break even in about 2.5 years

Worst Case:
	•	AMD calls go to $0
	•	TLT drops because inflation spikes, resulting in a 30% loss there as well. This is unlikely in my opinion but possible.

MI350X and MI355X should already drive healthy growth for AMD. However, MI400 will be the real game changer because of its scalability. AMD already raised the price for MI350, which just went into production, to $25,000 per chip. MI400 will be a true rack scale solution, making it highly competitive for large cluster projects.

These have been my conclusions.

# Options that have doubled or more in value

**At the market opening**

Calls: BCRX, BWXT, DD, ANET, ALAB, SHOP, DUOL, CELH, SOUN

Puts: NVTS, VRTX, BRBR, ETN, SMCI, SNAP, CLOV, FUN, SYM, FTNT, LLY, TTD, PINS, TWLO, SLVM

**Throughout the day**

Calls: W, FRPT, AXON, LSCC, PFE, LMND, MCD, APP, SONY, RKLB, KTOS, TEM, CGC

Puts: BRK.B, ON, TGTX, AMD, UPST, GEO, ELF, JOBY, ESTA, SMR, PAA, PAR

**It took more than a day**

Some options expire on the 15th, so maybe more will make it, although I doubt it.

Calls: TSN, PLTR, BP

Puts: HIMS, CAT, OPEN

# Straddles that have doubled or more in value

Straddle means buying both calls and puts, betting that there will be a big move, without knowing which direction.

**At the market opening**

VRTX, BWXT, FTNT, TTD, SLVM

**Throughout the day**

BRBR, LMND, ANET, ALAB, SHOP, FUN, DUOL, CELH, LLY, SOUN, CGC, PAR

**It took more than a day**

None

# Points to keep in mind

1. Data from Google Finance and Yahoo Finance.
2. Some stocks had very little or no options volume.
3. **In the post-earnings option price I am not taking into account the time value.**
4. For the strike I always use the closest to the closing price.

https://preview.redd.it/chlob1ywqvhf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b22eeedaee44db4f79d0cdb93701474ec737eb68

A stock has no options and another did not trade any put on 08/07/2025 with strike 17.5 and I made up the price (the one in red in the last image).

Why do companies that even their CEO doesn't know appear on Earnings Whispers?

# Is there a winning strategy?

When someone posts that they've gone from 100k to 200k with one of these plays I wonder:

Why didn't that person post the 100k YOLO?

Wouldn't that person be willing to publish his losses out of shame if he lost?

There are always people betting on both sides, there are always winners and losers.

What's the point of this then?

I would love to see someone go from 1k or 10k to 1M or more with several winning bets in a row.

1k \* 2\^10 = 1,024,000

10k \* 2\^7 = 1,280,000

Can anyone really get it right 7 times in a row?

With a lot of luck, you can even multiply by more than 2 and need to get it right less often.

I hope you share your opinion. Thanks for reading.

On every post I make that is longer than 5 complete sentences, someone accuses the post of being written by AI.

[Revenue by Segment and EPS](https://preview.redd.it/5ut7zj4ccuhf1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=66f3898cf08e8c71f25064cd9611a61cb05ef3c3)

GPT5 is expecting strong numbers from NVDA's Data Center Segment, while its Gaming and Prof. Visualization estimates are lower than mine. GPT5 is slightly more bullish Robo & Auto than I am.   


# The Estimates Stacked Up:

[GPT5 noted this as a fair way to represent their estimates](https://preview.redd.it/9u6xxt9wcuhf1.png?width=1756&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6270483896b29093ca5d80ac7db2f1f61adb0c3)

This is what the three estimates look like stacked against each other, and it now offers a wide range of perspectives. Analyst consensus is almost always conservative (going on 3 consecutive years of beats), so comparing my detailed analysis to a likely-sandbagged estimate is hardly fair. Since AI is supposed to take my job as an analyst, let's see how the actuals compare.  


# Positions:

Still in my 200 shares and ATM (Bit ITM now) Covered Calls, looking to manage in September or October.

# TLDR:

\- My Estimates Increased Slightly to $1.03 EPS on $46.4 Billion in Revenue

* Tesla Inc. has secured a Transportation Network Company rideshare license in Texas under the name **Tesla Robotaxi LLC**, joining operators such as Uber and Lyft.
* The license is mandated by a new Texas law, effective September 1, 2025, that brings autonomous-vehicle–based services under the same regulatory framework as traditional human-driven rideshares.
* This permitting follows Tesla’s June launch of an invite-only robotaxi pilot in Austin, where Model Y vehicles running Full Self-Driving software have been operating with remote oversight.
* Notably, the Texas permit’s **“Safety Driver”** field is marked **“No,”** underscoring that Tesla’s Austin robotaxi service is running **fully driverless**.
* In response, shares of Uber and Lyft dipped on the heightened competition, while Tesla’s stock rose on the prospect of a fully autonomous rideshare network.

(NASDAQ: NBIS) — Q2 FY 2025 Snapshot**

* **Explosive top-line growth**[**.**](https://imgur.com/a/Pzs2XqZ) Revenue jumped to **$105.1 million**, up **+625 % YoY** and **+106 % QoQ**, as demand for the company’s AI-focused cloud infrastructure surged.
* **Positive inflection in core operations.** The Nebius AI Cloud segment moved into **positive adjusted EBITDA**, narrowing the overall adjusted EBITDA loss to **-$21.0 million** versus -$58.1 million a year ago.
* **Headline GAAP profit driven by one-time gain.** A **$597 million mark-to-market gain** on equity holdings swung GAAP net income to **$502.5 million**; excluding special items, **adjusted net loss was –$91.5 million**.
* **Raised outlook.** Management lifted 2025 year-end **ARR guidance to $900 million–$1.1 billion** (previously $600 million–$800 million).
* **Scaling for AI demand.** Cap-ex more than tripled YoY to **$510.6 million** as Nebius accelerates data-center build-outs and works to secure **>1 GW of power capacity by 2026**.
* **Balance-sheet & share data.** Cash fell to **$1.68 billion** after heavy investment; 238.7 million shares outstanding (Class A + B) plus options/RSUs.
* **Street reaction.** Shares rose **≈16 % pre-market to \~$64** following the release.
* **Next events.** Earnings webcast today at **8 a.m. ET**; next scheduled report: Q3 results in late October.

**Takeaway:** Nebius is rapidly converting surging AI-infrastructure demand into triple-digit revenue growth and edging toward operating profitability. The upgraded ARR target signals confidence in continuing momentum, though cash burn and cap-ex remain elevated as the firm races to build capacity and lock in power supplies.

EDS in the 1970s was the hot stock trading for a p/e of 500+. The company crashed and later got acquired by HP (what is HP you say? Good question). 

About EDS: 

Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS) is a recognized leader in the management of information technology. The company designs, installs, and operates data processing systems for customers in the automotive, communications, energy, financial, government, healthcare, insurance, retail distribution, transportation, utilities, and manufacturing industries. An innovator in facilities management, EDS originated the concept of long-term fixed-price contracts for this industry. EDS owns the largest private digital telecommunications network in the world and conducts business in all 50 states and in 27 countries.


Sounds similar?? I think so! However, PLTR is mostly taking money from the government and plugging chatGPT into a UI.

PLTR is now trading at a 575 P/E.

I bring you the META of 2025, Sarepta Pharmaceuticals $SRPT which is currently trading at a PE of 2. The stock was trading at $150 last year and is currently trading at at $17.3. The reason two patient deaths in non- ambulatory patients earlier this year. The company has since stopped shipping shipments for non-ambulatory patients.

Revenue Breakdown: The company had $2.2 billion in revenue last year based on 4 approved drugs on the market. 1 billion came from 3 drugs combined. Another billion came from the 4th drug named Elevidys. From the $1.2 billion share, 80% revenue comes from ambulatory patients. Hence, even if the shipments to non-ambulatory population is halted, the company can still make around 1 billion revenue from the ambulatory population. More than 800 ambulatory patients have been dosed in past 2 years and there have been 0 deaths. The targeted patient population are young guys who have rare disease named DMD which causes patients to lose the ability to walk at 12 and confirmed death in their 20's.

Earnings on 8/6: The company announced earnings today. The free cash flow was 200 million. At this run rate, the company is trading at a Price to Earnings of 2 and Price to Sales of 0.8. Normally biotech companies have a Price to Sales of 3-4 making this stock very undervalued. Stock is up 8% 🚀after Earnings today 

FDA Drama: There was a recent death of non-ambulatory patient undergoing a Phase 1 trial (different drug than Elevidys) and the FDA commissioner Vinay Prasad asked the company to pause shipments for both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients. The decision was reversed in 3 days and the company was allowed to continue shipping the product for ambulatory patients. This controversy got the FDA commissioner Vinay to get fired on the same day. This tells u how strong the company's lobbying and patient advocacy groups are

Position: 220k worth of share at average 16.50.

Target Price: $50+ by end of 2025

I used it a few times and it seems like a shoddy combination of google search (brings up reddit threads) and LLM (where an AI summarizes them poorly).

People have google and ChatGPT as the dominate incumbents for search. You go on any of those platforms and ask a question and its likely reddit threads will popup, along with other sources, giving a user a wide range of sources. And how can Reddit compete with the behemoths of Google search and LLM of ChatGPT/Gemini? If Reddit answers becomes a thing, could google/chatgpt work to reduce showing reddit results and thus lower DAU?

I also feel like users have already switched between google and chatGPT recently, and are not interested to try out a new platform of reddit search, and already get reddit results from using those two platforms.

Also, if I want to search something on reddit, I can just use the search function and look up threads myself or append reddit to my google/chatGPT searches? I feel RDDT works best as the next generation forum technology that removes the need for any forum websites ever, and their data as AI training, and where humanity will rely on as the last bastion of human generated content.

This week I still did a few spy trades, but switched primarily to spx.  And these last 3 days have been incredible.  My account has gone from $4600>$9600>$30000>$93000 today.  
I’m sure I’ll get the usual comments about working at Wendy’s, put it on roulette, luck in a bull market, etc….and that’s cool.

(Reuters) -Super Micro missed Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday, as the company battles larger server makers for high-performance computers used to train artificial-intelligence models.

Shares of the San Jose, California-based firm slumped 15% in extended trading. They have soared 91% this year, as investors bet on strong demand for its AI servers and its liquid cooling solutions.

Super Micro has been gaining traction in the hyper-competitive server industry, but analysts have said larger rivals such as Dell Technologies and HP Enterprise have been able to leverage their vast customer base to boost sales.

""Since we know the market for servers is very strong right now, it is safe to assume the disappointing results for Super Micro are due to share losses,"" said Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson & Co.

""Their customers are very discerning right now and are choosing servers from Dell, HP and others,"" Luria added.

Super Micro expects revenue of at least $33 billion for fiscal year 2026, compared to analysts' average estimate of $29.94 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The company, which is bouncing back from accounting-related issues, said revenue for the three months ended June 30 was $5.76 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $5.89 billion.

Its adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share fell short of estimates of 44 cents.",2025-08-05,0.9823,Positive,"['AI', 'HP', 'HP', 'LSEG']"

$AEO – Post-Sydney Fundamentals for a Pre-Sweeney Price,1mi8yux,sitdownscrubs,2025-08-05 13:18:05,273,0.76,192,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mi8yux,"**$AEO Stock Performance**

$AEO is trading at damn near a 5-year low ahead of a major inflection point due to (1) comparable sales declining 3% YoY in Q1’25, (2) management withdrew ’25 guidance, and (3) gross margin pressure from tariffs. Despite the recent run-up, the stock is still trading at a 42% discount to its 52-week high. The market isn’t fully pricing in the impact on sales the Sweeney ad campaign is set to have and the company is set to return to a position of growth.

**Retail Stores Experiencing Heavy Traffic**

I have never seen people shopping in an $AEO retail location in my life, but last weekend was the first time I’ve ever seen an $AEO store filled with people and with a line of people waiting to check-out. Note that the area of this mall leans democratic as well. I also spoke with one of the store employees and he said the store has been the busiest he’s ever seen. Growing up, I’ve walked by this stores dozens of times and have never seen anyone in the store. $AEO has also done an excellent job with physically rebranding their retail locations.

**Why $AEO is Positioned to Violently Rerate**

The stock is set to violently rerate as tariff overhang alleviates while sales are set to see one of the biggest bumps in the history of the company. If management reinstates guidance at the next earnings and the Sydney sales bump materializes, I don’t see how this stock isn’t trading at >$20 within the next month. The company has historically traded at a 20x TTM P/E ratio and at a $13.30 share price, today’s valuation implies a \~13x TTM P/E ratio.

We all know how hard $ANF ran, $AEO has the same potential and has historically been a company written off for dead. Literally thought this company went bankrupt and have never heard any mentioned of it until the Sweeney ad campaign

Not to mention, I interviewed women in their 20’s about the quality and fit of the jeans and feedback was positive all around. Women have noted that the jeans run large, thereby allowing customers to wear jeans in sizes smaller than they usually fit, creating a self confidence booster.

Could waste time typing up more about financials and why operating performance has been shit over the last 1-2 quarters, but this is the most obvious thesis I’ve ever seen in my life.

**TLDR: $AEO IS THE NEXT $ANF**

**My positions:**

***Shares a lot***

***options a little: Jan 2026 $15, Jan 2027 $12, August 15th $10s. Also sold some $10 CSPs in August, but that's probably a little advanced for this class***

$PTLO earnings releases on Tuesday, and I think it is set up to take off.  Ever been like *""Damn if only I bought $wing, $cava, $cmg early"".* Well guess what, HERE YOU GO.

What is Portillos? Chicagoland fast casual that serves, burgers, Chicago style hot dogs, polish sausage, italian beefs, chocolate cake shake, etc. IPO'd late 2021 and bagged a bunch of people (like literally every IPO of the time). Since IPO has been focusing on expansion outside of Chicagoland

# Bull Notes (in no particular order)

* Activist investor group Engaged Capital took \~10% position late last year and been working with $PTLO to quality candidates to the board and optimize expansion and restaurants. There most relevant and impressive work is with Shake Shack

* Jack Hartung was added to the board this year. He was CFO of Chipotle for 22 years and is current president. Has Chipotle fallen off in recent years, yes. But what we care about is he was apart of the EXPLOSIVE GROWTH of Chipotle since pre 2006 IPO. He is also on the board of $TSLA, which is cool, i guess (Portillo's Tesla diner anyone?) Pre chipotle he did 18 years for Mcdonalds Corp. Guy is solid
* Most recently, Eugene Lee was added to the board in June. CEO of Darden Restaurants from 2015-2022. Darden has some big name restaurants in their portfolio, so another star player to the leadership team that can guide Portillo's along the growth journey

https://preview.redd.it/yblypmfchzgf1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5f4aece1ba9ec6ffcbfbaddc5f9ecb4e4eedaf

* AUV (monies per restaurant) for Portillo's is crazy high $8.7 million per restaurant in 2025 (dragged down a bit by newer operations that aren't up to snuff yet). A chipotle does like 3 million, a texas road house does like 7 million. The only comparable I can find is Chik-fil-le which restaurants can do over $9 million. You should go buy there stock, o wait you cant.
* Total restaurants 94 at end off Q1. Restaurants were going loaded on the back half of the year. 1 Q2, 5-6 Q3, and 5-6 Q4. It'll be good to hear how that's progressing. My guess would be like 3-4ish by the time of the call. There goal is to get scale up to 12-15% per year and almost 10x restaurants to over 900 locations
* Breakfast. Experimenting with it, Already expanded locations from the initial 5 so thats promising. I've tried it, its delicious. Hope to hear some numbers. Mega bull example is McDonald's whose revenue from breakfast is like 25%. Maybe we could hope for a +10% revenue to start at full roll out (if its determined to make permanent and would likely only be chicagoland to start).  Would like to hear some numbers on the call
* PE current low 20s trading like its not a growth stock.

# Bear Notes

* Big sell off -10%  day, recently. Chipotle earnings caused a massive selloff in all restaurant stocks due to bad same store sales. I think its bullshit. Proof go look at $cake and $wing earnings last week. Turns its a chipotle problem not an industry problem. I guess sales go down when you charge more, give out less food, and treat customers like shit. This followed by general market tanking last week. This all to say its not PTLOs fault, its the market that's wrong!
* Daddy Powell cucking trump and won't cut rates. Yes generally small caps benefit from lower rates. They'd help PTLO thrive, but are not needed to survive and continue growing at a steady pace. Since jobs data got ""fixed"", maybe that changes sooner than later
* New restaurants performance. Growing pains IMO. Likely takes 1-2 years to reach maturity
* Poor stock performance. I call it opportunity.
* Cattle futures are to the moon. Think they've done pretty good keeping price up to offsets costs. Can they keep doing it?

Also a guy a X posted about this Wackoff guy and 2025 sure looks like Jackoffs CuMulation. If u google institutional ownership it is a whopping 97%. Smart money been stock piling to sell later to u chasers. Front run it for once in your life. Big SEXY volume rising into earnings. You know what moves tickers VOLUME.

You know how I know this shit can go? Cuz I already round tripped some shares this year. Lows under $8 to just under $16 and back where we are today. It was lonely at the top. I want to bring friends with me this time.

LUNR [DD] - Intuitive Machines Bull Case,1mh0i7h,zer0_chance284,2025-08-04 01:32:16,144,0.9,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mh0i7h/lunr_dd_intuitive_machines_bull_case/,"***General Background***:

Everyone who has read into this company knows that they had 'failed' IM-1 and IM-2 missions; however, in the eyes of people in the aerospace industry these are not true failures.

**IM-1** (Feb 22, 2024) was the **first U.S. soft landing since Apollo**; it touched down, tipped, but returned data.

**IM-2** (Mar 6, 2025) also reached the surface (**south-polar region, Mons Mouton**), but tipped inside a crater; it operated \~12–13 hours before power/thermal limits ended the mission, and still returned important data and tested novel systems (unlike competitors like Firefly).

Firefly’s Blue Ghost landed on the near side and ran >14 days, right before IM-2 'failed', which fueled even more negative sentiment toward LUNR. But IM-2 attempted a harder polar profile (low sun angles, deep shadows, rough terrain). Intuitive's next mission, IM-3, will target a near-side site, more like Firefly’s profile and *much more likely* to be successful.

IM leads the Moon RACER team with a $30M Phase-1 feasibility award (Apr 2024). NASA will pick one provider for a demo mission, then issue operations task orders under an IDIQ (ceiling up to $4.6B) through 2039. A Phase-2 win would create multi-year, recurring service revenue tied to Artemis surface ops.

LUNR also is working on an orbital transfer vehicle, a $9.8M Phase Two government contract through CDR positions IM for in-space mobility work beyond landers.

NASA selected Intuitive Machines for a potential 10-year, maximum of $4.82B IDIQ to provide lunar communications/navigation services core infrastructure for Artemis and commercial users. Early NSNS task orders are already funded; and relay-service revenue begins after the IM-3 satellite is accepted into operations.



***Catalysts:***

**Earnings (Aug 7th)**: Could announce new contract updates. Watch for information on their backlog.

**IM-3**: Reiner Gamma (near-side, well-lit, relatively benign terrain) carrying NASA’s Lunar Vertex suite and CADRE multi-rover tech demo. A successful 14-day surface campaign would materially de-risk Nova-C and validate service pricing. This is an easier mission and much more likely to be successful than IM-1 or IM-2. Will launch no earlier than Dec 2025. **IN ADDITION** \- IM-3 will release the first NSNS lunar data-relay satellite into lunar orbit, which will allow task orders from NASA to be filled, generating more revenue for Intuitive Machines.

**IM-4**: \~2027 Mons Mouton (again), lunar south pole... Carrying 2 more aforementioned satellites.

***Risks***:

**Execution**: IM-3 is somewhat of a breaking point after two tip overs.

**Contract Structure**: NSN/LTVS are IDIQ (Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity) ceilings, not guaranteed revenue.

**Competition**: Firefly, Astrobotic, Lockheed-led teams for Commercial Lunar Payload Services/Near Space Network/Lunar Terrain Vehicle.



***Quick Financials:***

Revenue: $62.5M (up 14% q/q).

Gross margin: 11% ($6.7M).

Operating loss: $10.1M.

Cash & equivalents: $373.3M at quarter-end (post warrant redemption).

Free cash flow: +$13.3M (operating cash $19.4M minus $6.1M capex).

Backlog: $272.3M (down from $328.3M Dec-24 due to work performed).

Outlook: FY25 revenue $250–$300M; run-rate positive adj. EBITDA by YE25, positive adj. EBITDA in 2026.



**My Position**:

[My LUNR Shares.](https://preview.redd.it/gmaqbjbmowgf1.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=049f6efc5bb94beff827c6d53503006847e607c9)

Had shares of LUNR since before IM-2, likely not selling until after IM-3.

*\*\*Repost; forgot to add my position the first time around.*



**TL;DR**: LUNR has meaningful contract runway (NSNS up to $4.82B, LTVS up to $4.6B, etc.) and cash. IM-2’s 'failure' didn't change that. In addition, if IM-3 sticks a clean near-side campaign and deploys the first NSNS relay satellite, it could result in a shift towards higher-margin services and could unlock more task orders.

I think we could easily see $20 per share again if IM-3 works out, and even higher with solid NSNS service orders and an LTVS Phase-2 win, thoughts?",2025-08-04,0.9959,Positive,"['IM', 'IM', 'IM', 'IM', 'IM', 'LUNR', 'IM', 'IM', 'IM', 'RACER', 'NASA', 'IDIQ', 'LUNR', 'CDR', 'IM', 'NASA', 'IDIQ', 'NSNS', 'IM', 'IM', 'NASA', 'CADRE', 'IM', 'IM', 'IN', 'IM', 'NSNS', 'NASA', 'IM', 'IM', 'NSN', 'LTVS', 'IDIQ', 'LUNR', 'LUNR', 'IM', 'IM', 'TL', 'DR', 'LUNR', 'NSNS', 'LTVS', 'IM', 'IM', 'NSNS', 'IM', 'NSNS', 'LTVS']"

1. NVIDIA and all big tech are customers
2. 20% short interest - presumably because of financial reporting fears. SMCI went from 3 million shares short a quarter ago to 95 million shares short now (Fintel). I know finance and this is no longer a problem. SMCI clearly announced they Do Not Need to restate earnings and their auditors found no instances of fraud (given US laws, you don’t casually declare this on an earnings call). 
3. Meeting or even slightly beating earnings will squeeze the shorts’ balls blue. OPEN had a short interest of 20.73%, look what happened when it squeezed.
4. Massive expected INCREASE in AI spend. Ex: Recent Google earnings announced increase to $85 billion. X (Grok) working to launch millions of GPUs and shipping a “power plant” from Europe to power it. Every AI player (MSFT, META, AMZN, Open AI etc) will do the same increasing spend to the 70-90bill range. TSMC also reported great earnings. Clear sign demand is accelerating not slowing.
5. International expansion - SMCI won a Major Exclusive $20 billion DataVolt (Saudi Arabia) deal, Ericsson.
6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.
7. BofA Analist Ruplu Bhattacharya, has a $35 price target on SMCI, but had a price target of $1,090 at one point, which is a ridiculous joke. Big funds probably have major short positions and are now caught with their pants down and are using their Analist to beat prices down. They don’t know computers. If SMCI reports spectacular earnings on 8/5/2025, and their tits get squeezed, she’ll be relegated to OnlyFans.",2025-08-03,0.8229,Positive,"['DD', 'TLDR', 'SMCI', 'SMCI', 'US', 'OPEN', 'AI', 'AI', 'MSFT', 'META', 'AMZN', 'AI', 'TSMC', 'SMCI', 'SMCI', 'SMCI']"

Anyone want to ride my RKT?,1mgupjb,lupina101,2025-08-03 21:11:21,70,0.64,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mgupjb/anyone_want_to_ride_my_rkt/,"RKT looks like it’s finally waking up and Friday’s move might just be the start of something big. The stock closed at 16.54, up 11.98 percent on 55.98 million volume compared to the 16 million average. That’s over 3 times the usual flow of shares moving through this thing, and the price held into the weekend instead of getting dumped. High of the day was 17.23, low was 15.04, and it never really lost steam.

This isn’t just a random spike. The float is 143.96 million with 56.34 percent short interest, meaning over half the available shares are borrowed against this stock. That’s 81.11 million shares tall with a tall ratio of 5.05. Any sustained buying pressure forces talls to fight over a small float, and when the price is already climbing like this, that pressure adds up fast.

The chart is finally turning. RKT is above its 20, 50, and 200 day moving averages for the first time in months. RSI is 65.8, showing strong momentum without being dangerously overbought yet. The 52 week high is 20.23 and the 52 week low is 9.52, and we’re still well below the top even after this breakout. Performance has been building too: up 10.27 percent this week, 13.52 percent this month, 29.42 percent this quarter, and 55.23 percent year to date. Momentum is clearly shifting in favor of the bulls.

The fundamentals show why the float is so tight. Insider ownership is 106.75 percent, and insiders have been holding while institutions are starting to step in with 35.52 percent recent inflows. When insiders own the majority and retail starts buying, supply dries up fast. Combine that with 55.98 million shares trading Friday, and talls don’t have much breathing room.

Analyst targets are behind the curve. The average target is 15.22, already passed, and this stock has a clear path to retest 18 to 20 in the near term. If 20.23 breaks, the next leg could get aggressive because technical traders will pile in and talls will have no choice but to start covering.

Friday’s move wasn’t luck. It was volume, momentum, and a tight float coming together. If the volume continues next week, RKT has all the ingredients for a real breakout run. I hopped in Friday with 249 shares after a bit of digging into them.

COOP DEAL AND WHY IT IS BULLISH

Rocket Companies’ $9.4 billion all-stock acquisition of Mr. Cooper Group is a highly bullish move because it instantly transforms Rocket into the most dominant player in the U.S. mortgage industry, combining its leading origination platform with Mr. Cooper’s massive servicing operation. The deal expands Rocket’s servicing portfolio to $2.1 trillion across nearly 10 million clients, meaning one in every six American mortgages will now be tied to the company. This scale gives Rocket more recurring revenue, deeper long-term client relationships, and lower acquisition costs while accelerating its AI-driven platform to simplify and speed up the homeownership process. Coupled with its earlier acquisition of Redfin, Rocket is positioning itself as a full-spectrum real estate and mortgage powerhouse, capable of driving higher loan volumes and capturing more of the market over time. The market typically rewards companies that secure industry dominance and create multiple revenue streams, which makes this merger a clear bullish catalyst for Rocket’s growth story.

"Mercedes profit drops 70%, Porsche EBIT down 67% as tariffs and EV slowdown hammer German automakers",1mgja0l,callsonreddit,2025-08-03 13:28:58,2906,0.97,634,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mgja0l/mercedes_profit_drops_70_porsche_ebit_down_67_as/,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-deal-aside-mercedes-and-porsche-see-more-tariff-pain-on-the-way-162251235.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-deal-aside-mercedes-and-porsche-see-more-tariff-pain-on-the-way-162251235.html)

Despite the contours of a preliminary trade deal, German automakers Mercedes (MBG.DE) and Porsche (P911.DE) are still in a world of pain, suffering from the strain of Trump’s tariffs and shifting consumer preferences in markets like the US and China.

First up, Mercedes.

In the second quarter, the luxe carmaker reported revenue fell 10% to 33.15 billion euros ($38.82 billion), on adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of 1.273 billion euros ($1.47 billion) — a drop of 68% from a year ago. Net profit fell nearly 70% to 957 million euros ($1.1 billion) in the quarter.

“A dynamic market environment, volatile tariff policies, challenging competition, particularly in China, and upcoming model changes impacted sales development,” Mercedes said in a statement.

As a result, Mercedes cut its 2025 outlook with revenue expected to come in “significantly below prior year level” compared to “slightly below” previously. The auto business now sees its return on sales (or margin) dipping to a range of 4%-6% compared to 6%-8% seen previously.

On the analyst call, Mercedes CFO Harald Wilhelm said the tariff impact was in the “mid-triple-digit millions,” adding that the second-half effect would be higher, but still in that range per quarter.

Wilhelm said the tariff impact this year would hit margins by 150 basis points (1.5%), despite the new, lowered tariff rate of 15% in place, compared to the 27.5% levied before the preliminary trade deal.

The Porsche situation isn’t much better.

The Stuttgart-based automaker said revenue fell to 18.2 billion euros ($21.04 billion) in the first half of 2025, down 6.7% from a year ago, with EBIT dropping to 1.01 billion euros ($1.17 billion), a third of the 3.06 billion euros ($3.54 billion) reported last year. Porsche said “extraordinary expenses” hit its EBIT, including 400 million euros ($462.4 million) in tariff costs.

As a result, Porsche said its return on sales for the year would dip to a range of 5%-7% for the year, down from the 14.1% it enjoyed in 2024. Likewise, it said revenue would drop to a range of 37 billion-38 billion euros ($42.8 billion-$43.9 billion), down from 40.1 billion euros ($46.35 billion) last year.

“We continue to face significant challenges around the world,” said Porsche CEO Oliver Blume. “And this is not a storm that will pass.”

While the preliminary US-EU deal would see the tariff rate decrease to 15% going forward for the European imported goods, that’s still a significant cost for the German automakers. The prior tariff rate was only 2.5%, meaning customers will be paying for the increased costs.

Tariff headwinds also come along the backdrop of shifting consumer preferences in China, the world’s largest auto market. Chinese domestic consumers are increasingly shunning products from foreign automakers — once considered the highest quality and most desirable — to domestic producers like BYD and Xiaomi, which have captured the fancy of buyers with styling and features Chinese consumers prefer.

In the US, the Germans face another challenge. Slowing EV adoption has hurt Mercedes and Porsche, which had bet heavily on an EV transition that many saw as inevitable during the Biden presidency. Mercedes is no longer taking new orders for its EVs in the US. Porsche is working through high inventories of its Taycan EVs, which means discounting at the dealer level.

And now tariff costs on top of that.

In the US, Mercedes has price-protected its customers for all model year 2025 vehicles, meaning it has absorbed tariff costs — for now. Porsche announced price increases of 2.3% and 3.6% for its US models in July, on top of earlier price increases coming in the 2025 model year.

SRPT Board is worse than Tesla board and should take some action to regain investor confidence. If they don’t fire this CEO or get this company sold soon ( maybe by Roche given they sell Elevidys outside the US), don’t think this stock is gonna turnaround.

Put 10k more in my account, immediately lost 5k of it then slowly grinded up to 14k mostly on RDDT calls leading up to earnings. Then, over just 2 days on this past Thursday and Friday I went hard on SPY puts (Mostly 1DTE) at the perfect time. Went from just under 14k to 86k by Friday morning.

Copper Tendies - A +500% setup,1mfx73a,scurzo,2025-08-02 18:10:02,159,0.88,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mfx73a/copper_tendies_a_500_setup/,"**Setup:**

The trade is essentially betting on a return to the mean on copper.  
All the tariff tantrums have caused a dislocation on the market, mispricing copper to the downside. However, after the recent DUMP, copper seems to have found a support level.

I’m writing it in bullet points so you retards can follow:

* **Supply Side:** Trump Tacoing from his copper tariffs caused a massive, oversized dump in copper. Driven by inventory overhang from the tariff’s threats which will be resolved in the upcoming weeks.
* **Demand Side:** Demand for copper is still strong with multiple tailwinds such as huge US deficit running the economy hot, AI boom, Power-grid boom, etc. All of which are main points in the current administration agenda, so there are no signs of stopping.
* **Technicals:** Even though the market dumped on Aug 01 due to the NFP report, copper held strong. Market (as seen on SOFR futures) is now expecting more rate cuts which only adds fuel to the fire, incentivizing an already over stimulated economy. Dovish rates expectations are also weakening the dollar which is bullish for commodities like copper.

**Trade:**

Copper COMEX Futures (Sep 2025)

**Entry:**  
Around current price of $4.45

**Take Profit:**  
On the green crayon (return to the uptrend mean), around $5.1 to $5.15

**Position:**  
Long 4 × Micro Copper Sep-25 (MHGU25) @ 4.45,

SL 4.30, TP 5.20 — max risk ≈ $1 500, target ≈ $7 500. (+500% setup)
