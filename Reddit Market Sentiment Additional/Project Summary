Got it ✅
Here’s a structured project summary of our entire process together. I’ll make it self-contained, clear, and suitable for revisiting or sharing.

# **Project Summary: Reddit Sentiment Analyzer → Web App with Streamlit**

---

## **1. Sequence of Steps Taken**

### **Phase A — Starting Point**

* Began with a Python script (`Reddit Market Sentiment Analyzer.py`) that analyzed Reddit posts for stock tickers and sentiment.
* The initial goal was to expand this script into:

  1. A **sentiment analysis UI** (search a ticker → see posts, sentiment distribution, top discussions).
  2. A **portfolio backtest module** (user inputs up to 5 stocks → see backtest vs SPY).

---

### **Phase B — Backtest Logic**

* Added rules for **entry/exit signals**:

  * Buy if sentiment > 0.05.
  * Sell if sentiment < –0.05.
  * Hold 1 day; equal-weight portfolio; 0.1% transaction cost.
* Implemented metrics: Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown, cumulative/annualized returns.
* Built logic to compare portfolio performance vs SPY (benchmark).

---

### **Phase C — UI Development (Streamlit)**

* Rewrote the script into modular blocks:

  * **Block A**: Imports & config.
  * **Block B**: Data loaders.
  * **Block C**: Price history (via yfinance).
  * **Block D**: Strategy helpers & metrics.
  * **Block E**: UI (ticker search + portfolio backtest).
* Integrated **Plotly** for charts and **Streamlit** for dashboard interactivity.

---

### **Phase D — Platform Choice**

* Evaluated deployment options:

  * JupyterHub (too clunky for UI).
  * Streamlit Community Cloud (free, beginner-friendly).
* Decided to deploy on **Streamlit Cloud** since user had no CS background and wanted minimal friction.

---

### **Phase E — GitHub Setup**

* Walked through creating a GitHub repo:

  * Upload `app.py` (main script).
  * Upload `analyzed_stock_data.csv` (sentiment data).
  * Add `requirements.txt` (dependencies).
* Linked GitHub repo to Streamlit Cloud for auto-deployment.

---

### **Phase F — Debugging Deploy Errors**

* Errors encountered:

  1. **Missing packages** (`plotly` not found).
  2. Wrong syntax (`!pip install` used inside app.py → invalid in production).
  3. Issues with Streamlit caching/unhashable lists.
* Fixes applied:

  * Added a **proper `requirements.txt`** with pinned versions.
  * Added **`runtime.txt`** to lock Python version.
  * Implemented an **install guard** inside `app.py` to auto-install libs if Streamlit cache ignored `requirements.txt`.
  * Removed notebook-only commands (`!pip`) from production code.
  * Made ticker lists immutable for caching.

---

## **2. Rationale Behind Each Step**

* **Entry/Exit rules** → Needed to formalize a simple, testable trading strategy.
* **Backtest metrics** → To compare strategy robustness vs SPY in a professional way.
* **Modular blocks** → Increased readability and debugging ease.
* **Streamlit Cloud** → Chosen for simplicity, free hosting, and direct GitHub integration.
* **GitHub repo setup** → Streamlit Cloud requires a GitHub source.
* **Pinned requirements/runtime** → Avoided mismatches in Python and package versions.
* **Install guard** → Safety net for missing packages in the Streamlit runtime.

---

## **3. Changes, Iterations, and Decisions**

* **JupyterHub → Streamlit Cloud**: shifted platform because JupyterHub couldn’t serve a persistent UI.
* **`Adj Close` bug**: fixed by using `yfinance`’s `"Close"` field consistently.
* **Caching errors with lists**: solved by converting lists to tuples before caching.
* **Plotly import errors**: addressed by enforcing installation with `requirements.txt` + install guard.
* **Notebook-only commands** (`!pip`) → replaced with proper dependency management in `requirements.txt`.

---

## **4. Final Result / Output**

* **Deliverable**: A deployable **Streamlit web app** that provides:

  1. **Stock search interface** → User types a ticker, sees sentiment distribution, post counts, and top Reddit discussions.
  2. **Portfolio backtest** → User enters up to 5 tickers, sees a 2-year backtest vs SPY with performance metrics, equity curves, and rolling Sharpe.

* **Deployment pipeline**:

  * Code + data pushed to GitHub.
  * Streamlit Cloud auto-builds environment via `requirements.txt`.
  * Public app URL generated (accessible via browser).

* **Outstanding**:

  * The app structure works, but deployment debugging continues around `plotly` import.
  * A minimal `mini_app.py` was suggested as a smoke test.
  * Once environment resolves correctly, full functionality will be live.

---

✅ **In summary**:
We transformed a sentiment analysis script into a **web-deployable stock sentiment dashboard + backtesting engine**. The project now has structured modules, a UI layer, and a deployment pipeline (GitHub → Streamlit Cloud). Remaining tweaks are focused on dependency installation reliability.
